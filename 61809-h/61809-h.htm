<p class="p6 fs70">All the world assenting, and continually repeating and reverberating, there
soon comes that singular phenomenon, which the Germans call Swarmery, or the
“Gathering of Men in Swarms,” and what prodigies they are in the habit of doing
and believing, when thrown into that miraculous condition....</p>

<p class="fs70">Singular, in the case of human swarms, with what perfection of unanimity and
quasi-religious conviction the stupidest absurdities can be received as axioms of
Euclid, nay as articles of faith, which you are not only to believe, unless malignantly
insane, but are (if you have any honour or morality) to push into practice, and
without delay see <em>done</em>, if your soul would live!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Carlyle.</span></p>

<h3 class="lsp">PREFATORY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">There are few matters among educated people upon
which opinion is so absolute and so ill-informed as vaccination.
They will tell you it has stopped smallpox and
does no harm, and if you venture to question either
assertion you are set down as an abettor of “those ignorant
and fanatical anti-vaccinators.” If undeterred you
inquire when smallpox was stopped, and which is the
harmless variety of vaccination, you will probably be
told that these are medical questions, whilst the facts
are indisputable; the answer running in the line of Old
Kaspar’s to Little Peterkin, inquisitive as to the good of
Blenheim&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Why that I cannot tell, said he,</p>
<p class="verse0">But ’twas a famous victory.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I am not complaining of this attitude of mind. We
all accept more or less on bare authority. In the multiplicity
and unsearchableness of knowledge, it is unavoidable.
Some years ago a venerable friend urged me to
write against vaccination, which, he said, was working
endless mischief to the public health. He would have
the book published, and provide whatever was requisite
for my satisfaction. I pleaded prior engagements, and
turned the conversation, thinking how sad it was that
one so good, and, in other respects, so enlightened should
be subject to so strange an illusion&mdash;I, then, taking
vaccination on trust as one of the numerous blessings
conferred upon mankind in the course of the present
century.</p>

<p>I am therefore disposed to make large allowance for
the credulous attitude of the public toward vaccination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
whilst at the same time insisting on its correction; and
for this reason especially, that vaccination is no longer
a matter of private concern. We are free to entertain
what notions we please, but if we proceed to enforce
them on unbelievers, we cannot complain if we are required
to answer for our aggression or encounter rough
usage. Enforced by the law of England, vaccination is
related to the life and intelligence of every citizen, and
it is consequently vain to claim for it exemption from
vulgar discussion. Apart from its compulsory infliction,
vaccination might be and remain an esoteric rite, the
very mystery of mysteries; but with compulsion the
privilege of sanctity is impossible.</p>


<h3>VARIOLATION.</h3>

<p>It has been said that beliefs and observances in themselves
most irrational wear a different aspect when viewed
in the light of their origin and history. It is so with
vaccination. Had it come upon the world as we know
it, with failure and disaster, equivocation and apology,
rejection would have been inevitable; but when we turn
to the past we discover that our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnosa hæreditas</i> has
a tradition that goes far to account for, if not to excuse,
the folly which remains.</p>

<p>Vaccination was the successor of Inoculation (or, more
precisely, Variolation), entering into a possession already
acquired in the human mind.</p>

<p>It had been observed from of old that some forms of
disease rarely recur in the same person in a lifetime; and
thus when scarlet fever, or measles, or smallpox broke
out in a family, it was considered prudent to let the disease
have its course, and thereby obtain immunity from
fear of future infection.</p>

<p>It was this confidence, that smallpox once undergone
was finally disposed of, that was the justification of the
practice of inoculating the disease when introduced from
the East in the first quarter of last century. Inasmuch,
it was argued, as none can have smallpox more than once,
why not induce it artificially, and pass through the illness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
at a convenient season? But Nature, though compliant,
does not always accept the course we ingeniously
prescribe for her. Smallpox as naturally developed (so
to speak) is a crisis of impurity in the blood, and if the
requisite conditions are absent, it cannot be adequately
excited. Hence variolation was an uncertain and hazardous
operation. It took with some and was indistinguishable
from an attack of ordinary smallpox; it took
partially, or not at all with others; and the operation
was frequently followed by malaise, disorders of the
skin, and grave constitutional derangements. Nor were
the variolated secure from smallpox. They occasionally
had smallpox with their neighbours, and then it was
said, “There must have been some mistake about the
inoculation; for it is impossible that anyone can be successfully
inoculated and have smallpox.” Further, the
variolated, while labouring under the induced malady,
conveyed the disease to their attendants and visitors;
and thus smallpox was propagated by the means intended
to avert it.</p>


<h3>THE PRECURSOR OF VACCINATION.</h3>

<p>At the close of last century, variolation had become
the custom of the upper and middle classes of England.
The trouble and the peril were disliked, but were accepted
in the name of duty. The variolation of their children
was an anxiety that weighed like lead on the hearts of
affectionate parents; and glad and grateful they were
when the operation was accomplished without serious
mishap. Patients designed for variolation were dieted,
purged, and bled; and smallpox from sufferers of sound
constitution was diligently inquired for. Mild smallpox
was in great demand and was propagated from arm to
arm. When Dr. Dimsdale operated on the Empress
Catharine he did not venture to convey smallpox direct
to the imperial person. He looked out a case of “benign
smallpox” with which he inoculated a strong young man,
and from the young man the Empress. Unless we realise
the inconveniences, the uncertainties, the disasters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the horrors of the practice of variolation, albeit minimised,
excused and denied by its professors, we can never understand
the enthusiasm with which vaccination was received
as its substitute. The promise conveyed in vaccination
was a relief inexpressible, bearing with it a show of
reason that was well nigh irresistible. The argument
ran thus: No one can have smallpox twice, and the
mildest attack is as protective from subsequent attack
as the severest. Therefore it is that in inoculation with
smallpox we find security. But inoculation with smallpox
is an uncertain operation with dangerous issues.
Here, however, in cowpox is discovered a mild variety
of smallpox, which may be inoculated with perfect ease,
and with no possibility of harm. And inasmuch as the
mildest smallpox is as preventive of future smallpox as
the severest, it follows that this gentle cowpox must
serve as a full equivalent for smallpox itself.</p>


<h3>IMMEDIATE TRIUMPH OF VACCINATION.</h3>

<p>It was in this plausible shape that vaccination had an
immediate triumph. The way was made straight for it
and every difficulty removed by the existing practice of
variolation. Dr. W. B. Carpenter says that vaccination
was more strenuously resisted at the beginning of the
century than it is at this day. He is completely mistaken.
Vaccination came upon a generation prepared
for it&mdash;which saw in it a prescription in full accord with
common-sense. The entire medical profession, with a
few exceptions, the King, Queen and court, were
converted straight off, and parliament and society followed
suit. It was, I confess, a natural development of
opinion; and we need have little doubt that had we lived
in those days we should have found ourselves shouting
with the genteel mob. The limited resistance offered to
vaccination was not based on physiological or sanitary
science: such science did not then exist. It was the
resistance of variolators who were satisfied with the
established practice and resented its disturbance; professing
at the same time immeasurable horror at the profanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
to humanity by infection with bovine disease.
Whilst we have no reason to identify ourselves with that
resistance, we have to recognise the service rendered by
the variolators in observing the results of vaccination&mdash;the
persistency with which they traced and exposed its
failure to prevent smallpox and the injuries and deaths
it caused. So far as the maintenance of variolous inoculation
was concerned, they fought a losing battle; but
they drove the vaccinators from post to post (cursed
while they did so as malignant false witnesses possessed
of the devil) and at last compelled the admission that
their infallible preventive could not be guaranteed to
prevent, but only to make smallpox milder&mdash;a safe assertion
because unverifiable, as disputable as indisputable
in particular instances.</p>


<h3>JENNER’S PROCEDURE.</h3>

<p>About the matter of this prophylactic there was from
the first a curious confusion which continues to this day.</p>

<p>Jenner was a country doctor at Berkeley in Gloucestershire,
a dairy country, where the maids believed that
if they caught cowpox in milking they could never afterwards
catch smallpox. Jenner when a young man was
inclined to accept the dairymaids’ faith; but when he
discussed it with his medical acquaintance, they ridiculed
him. They said, “We know that such is the dairymaids’
faith, but we also know that it is untrue; for we know
dairymaids who have had cowpox, and afterwards had
smallpox notwithstanding their cowpox.” Jenner was
convinced and said no more about cowpox.</p>

<p>To this point let me draw special attention. No man
knew better than Jenner that cowpox as cowpox was no
preventive of smallpox.</p>

<p>Toward middle-life he had what he conceived to be a
happy thought. Cowpox as cowpox he had dismissed as
impracticable; but there was a variety of cowpox which
he resolved to recommend.</p>

<p>Cows in Gloucestershire were milked by men as well
as by women; and men would sometimes milk cows with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
hands foul from dressing the heels of horses <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'afflicted with with what'">afflicted with
what</ins> was called <em>grease</em>. With this <em>grease</em> they infected
the cows, and the pox which followed was pronounced
by Jenner to have all the virtue against smallpox
which the dairymaids claimed for cowpox.</p>


<h3>HORSEGREASE COWPOX.</h3>

<p>According to Jenner, then, the dairymaids were right,
and they were wrong. They were right when the pox
they caught was derived from the horse through the cow;
they were wrong when the pox they caught originated on
the cow without the horse. He thus discriminated a
double pox&mdash;cowpox of no efficacy against smallpox, and
horsegrease cowpox of sure efficacy.</p>

<p>Further, in this connection, it is to be observed, that
farriers believed that when they got poisoned in handling
horses with greasy heels, they too, like the dairymaids,
were safe from smallpox.</p>

<p>It is not therefore for cowpox, but for horsegrease
cowpox that Jenner is answerable. In cowpox he had
not, and could have no faith.</p>

<p>In 1798 Jenner published his famous <cite>Inquiry</cite>, a
treatise much more spoken of than read, wherein he distinctly
set forth the origin of his chosen prophylactic. It
was <em>not</em>, I repeat, cowpox: <em>it was horsegrease cowpox</em>.
He carefully discriminated it from spontaneous cowpox,
which, he said, had no protective virtue, being attended
with no inflammation and erysipelas, the essential sequences
of inoculation with effective virus.</p>


<h3>REJECTION OF JENNER’S PRESCRIPTION.</h3>

<p>I have said that the world gave a cordial and unhesitating
welcome to Jenner’s revelation, but the observation
requires a startling qualification. Jenner’s revelation
as conveyed in his <cite>Inquiry</cite> was summarily and ignominiously
rejected&mdash;was absolutely rejected. I wish to
emphasise this point. Jenner published his <cite>Inquiry</cite> in
order to recommend horsegrease cowpox, and what I
have to say is, that the public declined to have anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
to do with horsegrease cowpox. The origin of cowpox
in horsegrease was scouted as an intolerable origin. It
was disgusting. Why a diseased secretion from horses’
heels should be more repulsive than a similar secretion
from cows’ teats was not explained; but, as we all know,
there is no accounting for tastes. Various attempts were
made to verify Jenner’s prescription by inoculating cows
with horsegrease, but they ended in failure&mdash;fortunately,
it was said, in failure; for as Dr. Pearson (chief among
primitive vaccinators) observed, “The very name of
horsegrease was like to have damned the whole thing.”
What did Jenner do under these circumstances? Did
he confront the public and assert the efficacy of horsegrease
cowpox? Not he. He wanted money. He saw
how the wind was blowing. He said not another word
about horsegrease cowpox; and as the public were eager
at any price to escape from the nuisance of smallpox
inoculation, and disposed to substitute cowpox as a harmless
substitute, why then he resolved to go in for cowpox,
and pose as its discoverer and promoter.</p>


<h3>JENNER’S TRANSFORMATION.</h3>

<p>I am not making what is called a constructive charge
against Jenner, but simply setting forth plain, undeniable
matter-of-fact. I ask any one in doubt as to what I
say to read Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>, published in 1798, the
prescription of which is horsegrease cowpox, and the
condemnation of cowpox. Turn then to his petition for
largess, addressed to the House of Commons in 1802, and
what do we find? Not one word about horsegrease cowpox,
but this audacious assertion:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That your Petitioner has discovered that a disease
which occasionally exists in a particular form among
cattle, known by name of Cowpox, admits of being inoculated
on the human frame with the most perfect ease
and safety, and is attended with the singularly beneficial
effect of rendering through life the person so inoculated
perfectly secure from the infection of Smallpox.”</p>

<p>Why, that was not Jenner’s discovery! It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
notion of the dairymaids, and, so far as concerned spontaneous
cowpox, was known by Jenner to be untrue.
Yet, strange to say, the claim was in a measure allowed
by the House of Commons, and £10,000 awarded to the
imposter, and subsequently £20,000 in 1807.</p>


<h3>HORSEGREASE COWPOX KEPT OUT OF SIGHT.</h3>

<p>As evidence of how completely Jenner’s prescription
of horsegrease cowpox was put out of sight, I may refer
to the treatise of Dr. Willan <cite>On Vaccine Inoculation</cite>,
published in 1806, wherein all that was thought important
concerning the new practice was set forth; and although
Jenner was freely cited, yet neither horsegrease nor
horsegrease cowpox was referred to from the first page
to the last. Instead, cowpox, after the fancy of the
dairymaids, was exalted as the true prophylactic, apparently
without a suspicion of its questionable character.</p>

<p>As I have said, Jenner not only offered no resistance
to this amazing transformation, but conformed to it, and
assumed the issue as his own. Since the public preferred
cowpox to horsegrease cowpox, he saw no reason why he
should object, especially as the same foolish public lusted
after some one to worship for their deliverance from the
plague of variolation. The world resounded with praises
of the immortal Jenner, the saviour of mankind from
smallpox. Enveloped in the smoke of such incense, it
is scarcely surprising that the idol came to believe that
his worshippers knew him better than he did himself.</p>


<h3>SPURIOUS COWPOX.</h3>

<p>The promise of vaccination, its absolute security and
harmlessness, was speedily belied. The vaccinated caught
smallpox; they fell sick after the operation; they were
afflicted with eruptions and swellings; they died. These
mishaps were at first denied&mdash;stoutly denied; and when
denial was no longer possible, it was attempted to
explain them away. The cowpox used could not have
been genuine cowpox, but spurious; and for awhile
spurious cowpox did yeoman’s service in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
apology; but by-and-by the excuse began to work more
harm than good. Mishaps were so numerous that people
became afraid of this omnipresent spurious cowpox, and
to ask what it was, and how it could be avoided. How
can there be spurious pox? Whoever heard of spurious
disease? Milkmen vend spurious milk, grocers spurious
sugar, smashers spurious coin; but surely cows are not
to be numbered with such malefactors as producers of
spurious pox! The thing was absurd on its face, and
absurd it proved. When Jenner was under examination
by a committee of the College of Physicians in 1806, he
was pressed hard for a definition of spurious cowpox,
when he “owned up.” He knew nothing of spurious
cowpox. The words had been employed, not to describe
any irregularity on the part of the cow, but certain
irregularities in the action of cowpox on the part of the
vaccinated: which was to say that when the vaccinated
recovered creditably and did not catch smallpox, the
cowpox was genuine; but when the sequences were
otherwise, why then it was spurious! Ingenious and
convenient, was it not?</p>


<h3>HORSE VIRUS VINDICATED.</h3>

<p>Reverting to Jenner’s suppression of the origin of cowpox
in horsegrease, it may be suggested that he had
changed his mind: but he had not changed his mind.
As observed, various attempts were made to inoculate
cows with horsegrease, and that these attempts were
failures; but subsequent attempts were successful.
Tanner, a veterinarian, of Rockhampton, Gloucestershire,
succeeded to Jenner’s complete satisfaction. Dr. Loy of
Whitby dispensed with the cow altogether, and inoculated
with horsegrease, or horsepox, producing vesicles
identical with those of cowpox. The great success, however,
in this line was reserved for Sacco of Milan.
From the hand of a coachman poisoned with horsegrease
he inoculated nine children, and from the virus thus
engendered operated on every side. Writing to Jenner
in 1803, Sacco said&mdash;“It is now admitted and settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
that grease is the cause of vaccine, and we cannot too
soon alter the designation to equine.” De Carro of
Vienna received this equine from Sacco, and used it so
freely and successfully among the Viennese, that, in his
own words, it became impossible to say which of the
citizens were equinated and which vaccinated.</p>

<p>What did Jenner make of these confirmations? He
was adjudged mistaken in asserting that the cowpox
good against smallpox was derived from horsegrease.
Did he appeal with triumph to the evidence of Sacco,
and say, “You thought me wrong, but see, I was right!”
Not he. He kept silence. He consented to be treated
as in error. He stood by and allowed cowpox to be used
in which he had no confidence whatever. Nay more.
He consented to be rewarded and honoured as the discoverer
of a pox (which he did not discover) in which he
was without faith, and had at the outset of his career
expressly rejected and condemned. He recognised that
it was expedient that the connection between horsegrease
and cowpox should be denied. He had his bill to settle
with the English people, and it was not for him to make
difficulties. When, however, he had obtained all he
could expect from public favour, and had got clear of
London and the oppression of its savants, why then he
resumed the expression of his original opinion; and still
further, like Sacco of Milan, he dispensed with the cow,
and inoculated straight from the horse. He supplied
the National Vaccine Establishment with horse virus;
he sent it to Edinburgh; he distributed it among his
medical acquaintances; he described it as “the true and
genuine life-preserving fluid.” What more need I say?
Such was Jenner; such were his tactics; and whoever
assumes his defence will assume a task in which he is
not to be envied.</p>


<h3>WHICH SHALL IT BE?</h3>

<p>Jenner died in 1823, and at that date three kinds of
virus were in use; first, cowpox from horsegrease or
horsepox; second, cowpox; third, horsepox. These of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
course were subject to inscrutable modification in transmission
from arm to arm: it is the distinct sources we
have to recognise. A patient intent on vaccination
might have said to himself, Which shall it be? Shall I
be cowpoxed? or, shall I be horsepoxed? or, shall I be
horsepoxed cowpoxed? How such an inquirer would
have been answered had he set his perplexity before his
medical adviser, I can only conjecture. Probably he
would have been rebuked for his intrusion into matters
outside his province. The little girl who quenched the
scepticism of her comrade with the dictum, “It is so, for
ma says so; and if it isn’t so, it is so, if ma says so,”
illustrates the manner of rebuff administered to those
who pry into professional mysteries. It is for you to
pay and for us to think is a formula by no means limited
to ecclesiastics.</p>


<h3>SMALLPOX COWPOX.</h3>

<p>Jenner was pleased to describe cowpox as a mild form
of smallpox; but for what reason, outside his pleasure,
he did not explain. Nevertheless the suggestion has
borne fruit. When virus has fallen short, it has been
asked, Why, if cowpox be mild smallpox, should not
cows be inoculated with smallpox, and a crop of virus be
raised? Various such attempts have been made, in which
Mr. Badcock of Brighton has been especially distinguished.
Mr. John Simon, writing in 1857, said, “Mr.
Badcock, from 1840 to the present time, has again and
again derived fresh stocks of vaccine lymph from cows
artificially infected by him; having vaccinated with such
lymph more than 14,000 persons, and having forwarded
supplies of it to more than 400 medical practitioners.”
When it is remembered that virus for half a dozen or
more vaccinations is taken from a single arm, and that
this process of reproduction is repeated every week, some
idea may be formed of the extent to which this smallpox
cowpox has been diffused over the country.</p>

<p>The original assertion that vaccination conferred life-long
immunity from smallpox was unwillingly abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
under stress of experience, until no respectable practitioner
pretended that the rite afforded more than a partial
or temporary security. In promotion of smallpox cowpox,
however, Jenner’s most extravagant claims were
revived. In Mr. Simon’s words, for the recipient of
smallpox cowpox, “Neither renewed vaccination, nor
inoculation with smallpox, nor the closest contact and
co-habitation with smallpox patients, will occasion him
to betray any remnant of susceptibility to infection.”
Untrue even of variolation, it is unnecessary to controvert
such a figment: it suffices to place it on record.</p>

<p>The hypothesis was, that smallpox inoculated on the
cow lost somewhat of its virulence; but if so, why should
not such cowpox inoculated on man resume its virulence?
We are apt to forget that the nature of things is not
controlled by our wishes, and that our interest in the
conversion of smallpox into cowpox, and its maintenance
as cowpox, is no warrant for fulfilment. I may also
remark that though smallpox cowpox has entered so
largely into currency, there is no evidence to what extent
it has displaced the preceding issues of horsegrease cowpox,
cowpox and horsepox. So far as we know, they
are all existent in the common blood, indistinguishable,
the stronger surviving, the weaker dying out: nobody
knows, nor can know.</p>


<h3>CONDEMNATION OF SMALLPOX COWPOX.</h3>

<p>That smallpox cowpox is in any sense cowpox is,
however, widely disputed, much confidence being placed
in the researches of the Lyons Commission in 1855,
presided over by M. Chaveau. This Commission, says
Dr. Charles Cameron, “proved incontestably that smallpox
can no more be converted into cowpox by passing it
through a cow than by stunting an oak it can be converted
into a gooseberry bush.” Cowpox, it is held, is a
disease of the cow, with no relation to smallpox. The
vesicles of each may be apparently identical, as are the
vesicles excited by the application of tartar emetic; but
that is no proof of essential identity. According to Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
George Wyld, “Smallpox inoculation of the heifer produces
not vaccinia, but a modified smallpox, capable of
spreading smallpox among human beings by infection;”
and Dr. Cameron boldly attributes the recent increase of
smallpox to the use of smallpox cowpox for vaccination.</p>

<p>Nor is Dr. Cameron singular in this opinion. Some
time ago, the Galway Guardians ran short of virus for
vaccination, when it was proposed to inoculate a calf
with smallpox. As soon as the Local Government Board
in Dublin became aware of the project, it was forbidden.
Why? Here is the deliverance of the Secretary&mdash;“Because
smallpox virus taken from the calf would
communicate that disease to the human subject, and be
thereby a fertile source of propagating the disease; and
would, moreover, render the operator liable to prosecution
under the Act prohibiting inoculation with smallpox.”
Thus the virus current in England, and credited
with miraculous virtue by Simon, is denounced as dangerous
and its use unlawful in Ireland!</p>


<h3>COWPOX REVIVED.</h3>

<p>The constant disasters of vaccination, the certain and
suspected communication of human diseases with the
virus propagated from arm to arm, have induced a wide
resort to cowpox under the designation of “animal
vaccination,” in contempt of the fact that disease in
cattle is as rife as among men, and inoculable. Still
the dread of the invaccination of syphilis is so intense,
and so justifiable, that other risks are encountered if that
may be avoided.</p>

<p>This cowpox is commended as “pure lymph from the
calf,” a sweet periphrase with a savour of Daphne and
Chloe, of Flora and the country green&mdash;a periphrase
used in craft or ignorance, “pure lymph” being as incapable
of producing vaccinia as pure milk or pure
saliva. The prescription takes us back to Jenner’s time
and Jenner’s procedure. As has been said, the Gloucestershire
dairymaids believed that after cowpox they were
safe from smallpox, and that Jenner was much impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
with their belief until he discovered that it was untrue.
Had he found it true, he might have advertised the
prophylactic thirty years in advance of the publication
of his <cite>Inquiry</cite>; but if anything was certain, this was
certain, that cowpox did not avert smallpox. Satisfied
that cowpox <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> was of no avail against smallpox, he
defined a variety of cowpox generated by the application
of horsegrease, to which he was pleased to ascribe
sovereign efficacy. Why, I ask, did he discriminate and
prescribe that variety of cowpox if cowpox <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> was
effective? The question answers itself. I will not say
the cowpoxers treat Jenner’s evidence with disrespect;
for such is their ignorance, that I question if they are
aware of its existence; moreover, that which is undesirable
to know, is instinctively avoided and kept out of sight.
They recommend their “lymph” as wonderfully mild,
being attended with no erysipelas, the pest of arm-to-arm
vaccination&mdash;a description that tallies exactly with
Jenner’s of impotent cowpox. “The pustules,” says
Jenner, “are of a much milder nature” than those of
horsegrease cowpox. “<em>No erysipelas attends them</em>, and
they are incapable of producing any specific effect on
the human constitution.”</p>


<h3>A COWPOX CHARLATAN.</h3>

<p>Yet, incredible as it may appear, it is with the
praise of this impotent cowpox, attended with no
erysipelas, that the public have been deafened, and for
which the most extravagant assertions are made. Dr.
Martin, one of the chief producers and vendors of the
article, appeared at the British Medical Association in
1881, saying, “I am called upon at times, at the very
shortest notice, to vaccinate whole cities; and when I
left America, I had just completed the vaccination of
the city of New Haven. The custom is to send for me,
or my son, wherever smallpox breaks out, with orders
to vaccinate at once the entire population of the city,
town, or neighbourhood. It is done immediately, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
result being that an epidemic is completely stopped in
a week.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke the charlatan, with the acquiescence of the
medical assembly. When churchmen deplore the scepticism
of the age, and the decay of faith, it is to be observed
that the habit of mind is limited to certain modes of
opinion, and that in general we are as credulous as ever.
Human nature in its structure is curiously immutable.
Wherein is the advantage to disbelieve in witchcraft and
to believe that epidemics of smallpox can be stopped
with cowpox?</p>


<h3>A DECOROUS UNANIMITY.</h3>

<p>Such are the leading varieties of virus used for vaccination&mdash;starting
with Jenner’s horsegrease cowpox,
then cowpox, then horsepox, then smallpox cowpox, and
finishing with cowpox revived; each of them inscrutably
modified in transit from child to child and
from beast to beast. We are continually hearing of
miracles wrought by vaccination in the past and present&mdash;especially
the past, at home and abroad&mdash;especially
abroad, the assumption being that vaccination is, and
has been, everywhere the same. On the contrary, the
condition precedent to serious consideration of any vaccine
miracle is a definition of the variety of vaccination
practised. It is, we admit, convenient for the administrators
of the rite that it should pass for uniform, however
multiform; for the practice has become a great and
lucrative business&mdash;a world-wide poll-tax; and whatever
the internal differences of the priesthood, it is their
obvious interest to exhibit a decorous unanimity in
presence of their customers. Hence the uneasiness
recently excited by indiscreet advocates of “pure lymph
from the calf” has been judiciously allayed, not by
resistance, but by concession and damnation with faint
praise; the commercial instinct dictating caution, for if
the public did get behind the professional screen, and
discovered the mysteries of pox, what might not befall
the craft of vaccination!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>


<h3>JENNER’S SUCCESSIVE DISCLAIMERS.</h3>

<p>The story of vaccination is a story of failures, and as
each failure has become manifest, it has been more or
less artfully apologised for.</p>

<p>Much is given to assurance. People like infallible
prescriptions. They prefer an unequivocal lie to an
equivocal answer. This adventurers understand, and
discourse accordingly. Hence when Jenner solicited
Parliament for largess, he did so in no doubtful terms.
He boldly declared that cowpox was “inoculated on the
human frame with the most perfect ease and safety,”
and was “attended with the singularly beneficial effect
of rendering through life the person so inoculated perfectly
secure from the infection of smallpox.” Again he
said, “The human frame, when once it has felt the influence
of genuine cowpox, is never afterwards, at any
period of its existence, assailable by smallpox.”</p>

<p>It is needless to point out that Jenner was without
warrant for his assertions. His experience did not cover
more than a few years; and he could not, therefore,
know that his specific would secure its subjects from
smallpox for life. He believed, or affected to believe,
his own assurance, and assurance being infectious, it
widely spread. The inoculation of cowpox became
fashionable among busybodies, male and female. Ladies
especially were numbered among Jenner’s favourites and
experts, operating, as he described, “with a light hand.”
Cobbett relates, “Gentlemen and ladies made the beastly
commodity a pocket companion; and if a cottager’s child
were seen by them on a common (in Hampshire at least),
and did not quickly take to its heels, it was certain to
carry off more or less of the disease of the cow.”</p>

<p>It so happened that prior to the introduction of vaccination,
a marked decline in the prevalence of smallpox
had set in, and for the continuance of this decline the
vaccinators took credit. “See,” they cried, “see what
<em>we</em> are doing!” But they failed to observe that the
decline prevailed among millions who did not participate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
in the cowpox salvation. Soon, however, cases of smallpox
among the vaccinated began to be reported. At
first they were denied. They were impossible. When
the evidence became too strong for contradiction, it was
said, “There must have been some mistake about the
vaccination; for it is incredible that any one can be properly
vaccinated and have smallpox: the human frame,
when once it has felt the influence of genuine cowpox,
is never afterwards, at any period of its existence assailable
by smallpox.” Either some carelessness on the part
of the vaccinator, or some defect in the cowpox served
for a while to reassure the faithful; but ultimately these
reassurances utterly broke down. Persons vaccinated by
Jenner himself caught smallpox and died of smallpox.
Then said Jenner, “I never pretended that vaccination
was more than equivalent to an attack of smallpox,
and smallpox after smallpox is far from being a rare
phenomenon; indeed, there are hundreds of cases on
record, and inquiry is continually bringing fresh ones
to light.” True; very true; but what then of the
assurance and prediction under which £30,000 of the
people’s money had been pocketed&mdash;“The human frame,
when once it has felt the influence of genuine cowpox, is
never afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable
by smallpox”? Nay, more; Jenner descended
even lower. He not only likened vaccination to smallpox,
but to variolation, that is to the former practice of
inoculation with smallpox; and as, he said, variolation
was well known to be no sure defence against smallpox,
why should people be offended when smallpox in like
manner occasionally followed vaccination? Why, indeed!
but then the promise ran&mdash;“The human frame when
once it has felt the influence of genuine cowpox, is never
afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by
smallpox.” In a letter to his friend Moore in 1810,
Jenner said, “Cases of smallpox after inoculation are
innumerable.” And again, “Thousands might be collected;
for every parish in the kingdom can give its
case.” And he asked another correspondent, Dunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
in 1805, “Is it possible that any one can be so absurd as
to argue on the impossibility of smallpox after vaccination!”
And this from Jenner, who had deceived the
nation in 1802 with the assurance that, “inoculated cowpox
was attended with the singularly beneficial effect
of rendering through life the person so inoculated perfectly
secure from the infection of smallpox”!</p>

<p>Such was Jenner; such his inconsistency; and such
the admissions he was driven to make under stress of
failures many and manifest.</p>


<h3>SMALLPOX MADE MILDER.</h3>

<p>As vaccination failed to afford the protection originally
guaranteed, various explanations were devised to enable
those who had talked too loftily to eat humble pie without
painful observation. One of the commonest excuses
was that if vaccination did not prevent smallpox it made
it milder: and inasmuch as no one knew, or could know,
how severe any attack of smallpox would have been <em>without</em>
vaccination, it was an assertion as indisputable as the
reverse&mdash;namely, that vaccination not only made smallpox
severer, but frequently induced the disease. There
are many assertions with which there is no reckoning,
for it would require omniscience to check them. Let us
beware of such assertions. Let us neither make them,
nor suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by them.</p>


<h3>PUNCTURES, ONE OR SEVERAL.</h3>

<p>Another excuse was advanced in the report of the
National Vaccine Establishment in 1814. It was said
the failures in vaccination appeared to result from the
practice Of making only one puncture for the insertion
of virus. One puncture ineffective! Why, if one puncture
were ineffective, how were the early miracles of
vaccination to be accounted for, all of which had been
effected by means of single punctures?</p>


<h3>MR. RIGBY’S PROTEST.</h3>

<p>There was in those days a surgeon of eminence in Norwich,
Edward Rigby, and he at once entered his protest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
against the novel doctrine. Writing to the <cite>Medical and
Physical Journal</cite> of August, 1814, he said, “No physiological
reason is assigned for this, and I believe it
would be difficult to prove that a single perfect vesicle,
which goes through the usual stages and exhibits the
characteristic appearances of this singular disease, can
be less the effect of a constitutional affection than any
given number would be.... It cannot surely be doubted
that a single perfect vesicle affords as complete security
against Variola as any indefinite number; and, if so,
there would seem to be an obvious objection to unnecessarily
multiplying the vesicles, <em>which in all cases
go through a high degree of inflammation, are often
attended with painful tumefaction and even suppuration
in the axilla</em>, and, if exposed in the later stages
to any act of violence, <em>are apt to assume a very disagreeable
ulceration</em>, more especially as young children,
now the principal subjects of vaccination, are most
liable to suffer in this way.” Rigby had the better
side of the argument. As he observed, no physiological
reason was assigned for the recommendation of plural
punctures; nor was any such reason ever assigned. It
is the rationale of vaccination that a virus is injected
into the system which begets a fever equivalent to an
attack of smallpox; and as smallpox rarely recurs in a
lifetime, it is hoped that Nature may graciously recognise
the substitute for the reality. Organic poisons such
as vaccine operate like fire or ferment. Quantity is of
no account. So that the fever be kindled, excess is
waste. A scratch at a dissection is as deadly as a gash.
One bite of a mad dog is as likely to beget hydrophobia
as a dozen. The sting of a cobra may be almost
invisible, but the puncture is enough for death. Sir
James Paget says of vaccine virus that “inserted once,
in almost infinitely small quantity, yet by multiplying
itself, or otherwise affecting all the blood, it alters it
once for all.”</p>

<p>Such is the rationale of vaccination, and if I were a
vaccinator, I should hold the position assumed by Rigby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
and maintain that one puncture is as effective as a dozen,
inasmuch as with one it is possible to excite that fever
which is the essential of vaccination; adding, in Rigby’s
words, that as one puncture is in all cases attended with
a high degree of inflammation, and often with painful
tumefaction, and even suppuration in the arm-pits, which
in case of violence are apt to pass into very disagreeable
ulceration, especially in young children, it is most undesirable
to increase the number of such dangerous
wounds.</p>


<h3>MR. (MARKS) MARSON.</h3>

<p>I do not know that the condemnation of single punctures
at that time, seventy years ago, had much effect.
Two punctures became common, chiefly to guard against
the possible failure of one. It is of late years that the
resort to many punctures has become fashionable. Mr.
Robert Lowe, now Lord Sherbrooke, in the House of
Commons in 1861 spoke of “the beautiful discovery which
had been made, that the security of vaccination may be
almost indefinitely increased by multiplying the number
of punctures”! The chief author of this remarkable
discovery was Mr. Marson, for many years surgeon
of the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate. He estimated
the efficacy of vaccination by marks, and made so much
of marks that I usually think of him as Marks Marson.
He said&mdash;“A good vaccination is when persons have been
vaccinated in four or more places leaving good cicatrices.
I define a good cicatrix in this way: a good
vaccine cicatrix may be described as distinct, foveated,
dotted, or indented, in some instances radiated, and having
a well, or tolerably well, defined edge. An indifferent
cicatrix is indistinct, smooth, without indentation, and
with an irregular or ill-defined edge. When I find that
a person has been vaccinated in at least four places,
leaving good marks of the kind which I have described,
that person invariably, <em>or almost invariably</em>, has smallpox
in a very mild form.”</p>

<p>Reading a statement like this, we revert to the rationale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
of vaccination, and ask what can marks have to do
with its efficacy? Remember, Marson offered no explanation
of his statement. He was satisfied to say thus and
thus have I observed, and you may take my word for it.
But in science we take no man’s word. We must see, or,
like Trelawney’s Cornishmen, we must know the reason
why. Marson appeared before the House of Commons’
Vaccination Committee in 1871, and set forth his marks
doctrine with all the qualifications and inconsistencies
which characterise the victim of a fad in contact with
facts which his fad fails to include or account for.</p>


<h3>MR. WHEELER’S RESEARCHES.</h3>

<p>Fatal cases of smallpox are confluent cases, and in confluent
cases vaccination marks rarely show up so as to
answer to Marson’s description of marks distinct, foveated,
dotted, or indented, with a well, or tolerably well-defined
edge. And in this matter our acute and industrious
friend, Mr. Alexander Wheeler, has explored the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'records of the the Smallpox'">records of the Smallpox</ins> Hospitals, and proved that
vaccination marks many or vaccination marks few have
no influence whatever on the character or issue of smallpox.
As Mr. Wheeler shows, the classification of smallpox
into discrete and confluent is the only clue to the
right estimation of the fatality of the disease. Smallpox
in the discrete form, that is, when the pustules are distinct
and separate, is not dangerous when uncomplicated
with other disease, the overwhelming majority of patients
recovering, vaccinated or unvaccinated. The contest
between life and death is waged among the confluent
cases, where the pustules are so close that they run
together; and it is on these confluent cases, and the conditions
and antecedents of the sufferers, that attention
should be concentrated. There is a third form of smallpox,
the malignant, chiefly confined to persons of irregular
life, which is almost invariably fatal, and, as vaccinators
themselves allow, vaccination in malignant smallpox
affords no odds to its victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span></p>


<h3>MR. ROBINSON’S OPINION.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, as Mr. Enoch Robinson has pointed out,
there <em>is</em> something to be said for what Marson called
good vaccination marks. The bit of reality that constitutes
the basis of the marks illusion is this, that a well-formed
vaccine cicatrix represents a strong vitality with
vigorous healing power; whilst an ill-formed cicatrix
represents a contrary habit of body; and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>,
those who heal well under vaccination stand likely to
make the best recoveries in the event of smallpox. Good
marks are simply notes of good constitutions, and the
rest follows. Aught beyond is mere medical rubbish, on
a par with faith in omens and divination in tea-cups.</p>


<h3>CRUELTY OF MARKING.</h3>

<p>Vaccination, in whatever form, is bad, but this faith in
marks aggravates its cruelty. Mr. Claremont, vaccinator
for St. Pancras, operates on infants by the thousand, and
inflicts on each four marks. At a recent inquest on an
infant, the victim of his handiwork, I heard him say,
“The mothers nearly always protest.” Of course they
do. What kind of mothers would they be if they did
not protest! Apart from the venom, the shock to an
infant’s life from such wounds is very serious. Mr.
Young was called the other day to see a dying infant
vaccinated by this Claremont. Previous to vaccination
it was perfectly healthy, but never afterwards. From
the time of the operation it fell under a blight. “In its
coffin,” said Mr. Young, “it lay like a child’s doll&mdash;the
poor babe had wasted away.”</p>

<p>I was glad to see in the <cite>Times</cite> about a year ago a letter
from Dr. Allnatt of Cheltenham protesting against the
cruelty of vaccination as practised upon the children of
the poor. He recalled the days when he was a pupil of
Dr. Walker, in 1825-26, and his instructions were to dip
the point of the lancet into the fresh lymph, and insert
it tenderly without drawing blood, under the cutis of the
forearm, and protect the wound with a slight compress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
“But the case is altered now,” he says. “Some of the
vaccinators use real instruments of torture. Ivory
points are driven into the flesh, and wounds ensue which
become erysipelatous, and in the delicate constitutions
of weakly children fatal.”</p>

<p>The case is altered now, says Dr. Allnatt; but why is
the case altered now? Why, because, under the old
terms vaccination was more and more seen to be no defence
against smallpox; and to preserve the rite, and the
gains from the rite, the marks doctrine was invented, or,
rather, revived, and hailed as a sort of revelation from
heaven.</p>


<h3>REVACCINATION INTRODUCED.</h3>

<p>When vaccination was seen to be no preventive of
smallpox, it was conjectured that it might require renewal,
a suggestion which distressed Jenner exceedingly.
It was calculated, he said, “to do unspeakable mischief,”
depriving his discovery “of more than half its virtues.”
But as experience continued to belie the claim made for
vaccination as a permanent defence, it was natural that
those interested in its performance should endeavour to
retrieve its waning credit. Thus revaccination began to
be practised. Between 1830 and 1835 there were 13,861
revaccinations effected in the army of Wurtemburg. Dr.
Holland (subsequently Sir Henry) after recording the
accumulating proofs of the futility of vaccination in
1839, recommended revaccination as a probable resource,
and the recommendation gradually acquired authority.
The <cite>London Medical Gazette</cite> in 1844 boldly proclaimed,
“Revaccinate, revaccinate!” But so late as 1851 the
National Vaccine Establishment protested against the
innovation, saying, “The restriction of the protective
power of vaccination to any age, or to any term of
years, is an hypothesis contradicted by experience and
wholly unsupported by analogy.” Whatever the experience,
however, and whatever the analogy, there was
the indisputable fact, that vaccination in most unimpeachable
form did not avert smallpox, and that if the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
faith and the public money were to be retained, some
fresh artifice was essential. It was hard to surrender the
original claim of the equivalence of vaccination to smallpox;
but it needs must when the devil drives; and so it
has come to be admitted that Jenner was mistaken, and
the vaccine rite to be effectual must be renewed.</p>


<h3>VACCINISATION.</h3>

<p>Dr. Colin expresses what is now the common medical
opinion in saying, “We must not stop at a single vaccination.
We must establish the firm conviction in the public
mind, that vaccine prophylaxy is only real and complete
when periodically renewed;” and Dr. Warlomont, chief
of Belgian vaccinators, goes yet further in advising and
practising what he calls <em>Vaccinisation</em>; which is, that
every subject of the rite be vaccinated again and again
until vesicles cease to respond to the insertion of virus.
Then, and then only, can the victim be guaranteed from
smallpox! Such are the shifts to which vaccinators have
been reduced. If their insurance were valid, the premium
would exceed the principal, whilst there is no reason to
believe the new security is a whit better than the old.
In these frantic prescriptions we see the quackery in its
death-throes.</p>


<h3>ABSURDITY OF REVACCINATION.</h3>

<p>As for revaccination keeping off smallpox, it is absurd,
and ought to be known for absurd. The chief incidence
of smallpox is among the young, in whom it cannot be
pretended that the influence of primary vaccination is
exhausted. The subjects of revaccination are passing, or
have passed out of the smallpox age; and as the statistics
of the army and navy prove, our soldiers and sailors
are no more exempt from smallpox than the unrevaccinated
civil population of corresponding years. In
this matter, the old words stand true, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus vult
decipi; decipiatur</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE REDUCTION OF SMALLPOX.</h3>

<p>From whatever side regarded, the original and successive
claims made for vaccination are seen to have broken
down; but a practice endowed and enforced as a poll-tax
for the benefit of the medical profession is not lightly
surrendered. Instead a variety of defences, more or less
ingenious, are thrown out.</p>

<p>I.&mdash;One of these is the reduction of smallpox. It is
said, “Smallpox was once a common disease, and is now
a comparatively rare one&mdash;How are we to account for
this improvement otherwise than by the introduction
of vaccination?”</p>

<p>The answer is, that smallpox was declining before
vaccination was introduced, and that, too, in spite of the
extensive culture of the disease by variolation; and the
decline continued during the first part of the present
century whilst as yet nine-tenths of the people were unvaccinated.
Several diseases once common have abated
or disappeared; and why should we attribute to an incommensurate
cause a similar abatement in smallpox?
Leprosy, once extensively prevalent in England, has disappeared.
Why? It died out gradually; but suppose
some rite, analogous to vaccination, had been brought
into vogue contemporaneously with its decline, would
not the rite have had the credit, and would not its practitioners
have called the world to witness the success of
their prescription?</p>


<h3>HAS VACCINATION SAVED LIFE?</h3>

<p>II.&mdash;In the same line of defence, we have the claim
made for an extraordinary salvation of human life.
Thus Sir Spencer Wells in a recent speech observed,
“Jenner is immortal as a benefactor of mankind. It
may not be generally known, but it is true, that Jenner
has saved, is now saving, and will continue to save in all
coming ages, more lives in one generation than were
destroyed in all the wars of Napoleon.”</p>

<p>The answer to such a statement is to call for proof of
the lives saved. There is no proof. At the close of last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
century, 20 per cent. of the mortality of Glasgow was
due to smallpox. Smallpox abated, but did mortality
abate? Not in the least. Dr. Robert Watt in 1813
recorded the fact with amazement over it. And what
was true of Glasgow was true of other cities and other
populations. There may be a cessation of smallpox, but
(unless the result of sanitary improvement) the work of
death is merely transferred to cognate agencies. There
is no saving of life. What was a mystery to Watt is less
of a mystery since the development of sanitary science.
Zymotic disease in its various forms is a definite evolution
from definite insanitary conditions. It is not
affected by medical repression, nor by the spontaneous
substitution of one variety of fever for another. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'In the the words'">In the
words</ins> of Dr. Farr, “To save people from smallpox is
not enough whilst exposed to other forms of disease.
Thus in a garden where the flowers are neglected, to
keep off thistle-down merely leaves the ground open to
the world of surrounding weeds.” To lower the zymotic
death-rate it is necessary to reduce the conditions in
which zymotic disease is generated. Citing Dr. Farr
once more, “To operate on mortality, protection against
every one of the fatal zymotic diseases is required;
otherwise the suppression of one disease-element opens
the way for others.” Dr. Watt and Dr. Farr alike
believed that vaccination stopped smallpox, and alike
realised that the disappearance of smallpox was accompanied
with no saving of life. Sir Spencer Wells is of a
contrary opinion, which he shares with a number of
people who prefer the free, play of the prejudiced
imagination to the sobriety of exact information.</p>


<h3>WHO ARE THE UNVACCINATED?</h3>

<p>III.&mdash;Then we are asked to believe that though vaccination
may not keep off smallpox, it makes it milder,
and in proof we are entertained with low rates of mortality
among the vaccinated and high rates among the
unvaccinated.</p>

<p>We reply, to make a fair comparison between the vaccinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
and the unvaccinated, it would be necessary to
compare class with class, physique with physique, age
with age. In other words, the subjects of smallpox
should be constitutionally equal, their difference being
limited to vaccination present or vaccination absent. So
much is obvious.</p>

<p>But when or where has such comparison been even
attempted? Nor would it be easily practicable: for the
vaccinated comprise the best portion of the community,
physically; but who are the unvaccinated? They are
the waifs and strays of civilisation, the offspring of the
miserable and the vagrant, who, without fixed domicile,
escape the attention of the vaccination officer. These,
whatever their ailment, whether measles, pneumonia,
diarrhœa, would exhibit a higher rate of mortality than
the vaccinated; but would it therefore be safe to argue
that vaccination was not only good against smallpox,
but against measles, pneumonia, and diarrhœa? Yet it
is these, the lowest physically and most neglected of the
population, who drift into smallpox hospitals, who are exhibited
as fearful examples of the neglect of vaccination.
It might be added, they are unbaptised as well as unvaccinated,
and probably the one defect may be as prejudicial
as the other.</p>


<h3>UNVACCINATED DEATH-RATES.</h3>

<p>Our contention does not end here. Such is the prejudice
in favour of vaccination that a bad case of smallpox
is assumed to be an unvaccinated case. Over and over
again has it been proved that vaccinated patients dead
of smallpox have been registered as unvaccinated, their
death being taken as evidence of the absence of the saving
rite. Again in severe smallpox, when vaccination
marks are invisible, the sufferer is frequently
set down as unvaccinated. Dr. Russell, of the Glasgow
Hospital, relates that patients entered as unvaccinated,
showed excellent marks when detained for convalescence.
Had they died, they would have gone to swell the ranks
of fearful examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thus that the high death-rates of the unvaccinated
are accounted for, the framers of hospital reports appearing
to vie with each other in extravagance. We are
continually adjured in the newspapers to confess our
folly and repent, because 40 or 60 or 80 per cent. of the
unvaccinated have perished in this or that hospital
<em>because unvaccinated</em>. To us such statistics have fraud
written on their face, and the more they are sworn to,
the more unscrupulous do their vendors reveal themselves.
When all were unvaccinated last century, the hospital
death-rate of smallpox ranged about 18 per cent. Now
we are asked to believe that death-rate has doubled,
trebled, quadrupled, and for no other reason apparently
than to make for the glory of vaccination.</p>


<h3>NURSES EXEMPT FROM SMALLPOX.</h3>

<p>IV.&mdash;It is further said that nurses in smallpox hospitals
never contract smallpox because they are revaccinated.</p>

<p>To establish this assertion, it would be necessary to
prove that prior to the introduction of vaccination, or
rather of revaccination, it was common for nurses to fall
victims to the disease. The attempt is not made, and
wisely, for failure would be conspicuous. Jenner never
recommended vaccination as a protective for nurses.
Their general immunity, along with that of physicians,
is noted throughout our older medical literature; nor is
the reason far to seek. Smallpox is predominantly an
affection of the young, and it is no more surprising that
a nurse should be proof against it than that she should
be proof against measles, whooping cough, or scarlet
fever. Nurses occasionally incur these maladies, and
they occasionally incur smallpox.</p>

<p>If revaccination preserves nurses from smallpox, to
which they are exposed in the intensest form, it should
much more preserve soldiers, sailors, policemen and postmen,
whose exposure is incomparably less intense; yet
these servants of the state (as already observed) are as
liable to smallpox as their unrevaccinated fellow citizens
of correspondent ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>To speak plainly, the selection of a vocation so arduous
and repulsive, marks off a smallpox nurse as unimpressionable,
and little apt to catch anything. Smallpox,
too, is like tobacco: custom fortifies the constitution
against its immediate effects. If the atmosphere of a smallpox
hospital is endured for a fortnight, it is likely to continue
endurable. On the other hand, if a volunteer
sickens on probation, she is not reckoned among nurses.
Lastly, many nurses have entered hospitals as patients,
and have accepted service in default of other occupation.
On these grounds, the nurse argument breaks down
irretrievably. At first sight, it seems something, but
on scrutiny it proves nothing.</p>


<h3>POCK-MARKED FACES.</h3>

<p>V.&mdash;Another favourite argument for vaccination is the
disappearance of pock-marked faces. People say when
they were young such faces were common, whilst now
they are rare; and demand, What can have wrought the
change if not vaccination?</p>

<p>A medical man at a public meeting tried to dispose of
some statistics adverse to vaccination by saying that
statistics could be made to prove anything; and presently
went on to relate that when his mother was a girl every
third person she met was pock-marked. She had told
him so repeatedly, and there was no doubt about her
accuracy. Thus statistics in general were untrustworthy,
but his mother’s statistic was unquestionable.</p>

<p>We need not hesitate to allow that when smallpox
was common and cultivated pock-marked faces were
more numerous: but we must not forget that whether a
patient is marked or not marked is very much a matter
of treatment. Many at this day pass through smallpox,
and severe smallpox, and escape unmarked, simply because
those who have care of them observe certain
precautions. It was different in former times. The
treatment of smallpox was atrocious. The sick-room
was made pestiferous by the exclusion of air and the
maintenance of high temperature. The patient sweltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
under bed-clothes. He was neither allowed to wash nor
change his linen. He was drenched with physic and
stimulants. In hospitals, patients were stuck <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'two or or three'">two or
three</ins> in a bed, and stewed together. If, under such
circumstances, the sick were restored to life pock-marked,
what wonder! Patients who were fortunate enough to
be sufficiently let alone, stood the best chance of recovery.</p>

<p>Besides smallpox was not equally diffused. In some
places it was endemic; in others it appeared at intervals;
and in others it was hardly known. The smallpox
death-rate of Glasgow was double that of London; and
we may therefore infer that pock-marked faces were
twice as numerous in Glasgow as in London. Hence
when recollections are appealed to, they should be localised.
What might be true of one population might be
grossly untrue of another.</p>

<p>It has been observed that smallpox was falling off
toward the close of last century, and the decline accelerated
in the present century, irrespective of vaccination.
An excellent illustration of this reduction of smallpox is
furnished by the reports of the National Vaccine Establishment
for 1822, 1825, and 1837, where the disappearance
of pock-marked faces from London is triumphantly
recorded and claimed as a result of vaccination. In 1831
Dr. Epps, director of the Royal Jennerian Society, made
the like observation and the like claim, saying, “Seldom
are persons now seen blind from smallpox. Seldom is
the pitted and disfigured face now beheld;” adding,
“but seldom do mankind inquire for the cause. It is
vaccination. It is vaccination which preserves the soft
and rounded cheek of innocence, and the still more
captivating form of female loveliness.” Inasmuch as
not ten per cent. of the population were vaccinated in
1831, the claim made for vaccination was absurd, whilst
the disappearance of pock-marked faces was sufficiently
explicable by the reduced prevalence of smallpox.</p>

<p>Where then is the argument for vaccination from the
disappearance of pock-marked faces? When anyone
under seventy proceeds to recite the legend, “There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
no use in arguing against vaccination, for when I was
young every third or fourth person was pock-marked,”
etc., etc., the effect is droll. It shows how prone we are
to fancy we have seen what we think we ought to have
seen. Droller still it is when striplings of five-and-twenty
and thirty profess the same experience&mdash;“When
I was a lad,” and so forth and so forth. There is matter
for reflection as well as for laughter in the hallucination.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if pock-marked faces are not so common
as they must have been a century ago, they are by no
means rare; and if the argument for vaccination were
valid, the pock-marked would be unvaccinated. But are
they? Those who will take pains to inquire will find
that almost invariably they have been vaccinated, and
some of them repeatedly, the vaccination having as it
were induced the smallpox.</p>


<h3>VACCINIA A REAL DISEASE.</h3>

<p>Thus far we have chiefly dealt with vaccination as if
its fault were limited to failure to prevent smallpox; but
vaccination is more than an ineffective incantation. It
is the induction of an acute specific disease. The prime
note of vaccination is erysipelas. “The cowpox inflammation,”
said Jenner, “is always of the erysipelatous
kind.” He held that cowpox unattended with erysipelas
was “incapable of producing any specific effect on
the human constitution.” If it is supposed that Jenner
is antiquated, we may refer to a distinguished contemporary.
Mr. John Simon replying to the question,
“Whether properly performed vaccination is an absolutely
inoffensive proceeding?” answers decisively, “Not
at all; nor does it pretend to be so.” The rationale of
vaccination is that it communicates a mild variety of
smallpox, and that with a little of the devil we buy off
the entire devil. Dr. Ballard, Medical Officer to the Local
Government Board, in his treatise, <cite>Vaccination: its
Value and Alleged Dangers</cite>, says, “Vaccination is not a
thing to be trifled with, or to be made light of; it is
not to be undertaken thoughtlessly, or without due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
consideration of the patient, his mode of life, and the
circumstances of season and of place. Surgeon and
patient should both carry in their minds the regulating
thought, that the one is engaged in communicating, the
other in receiving into his system, a <em>real</em> disease&mdash;as
truly a disease as smallpox or measles; a disease which,
mild and gentle as its progress may usually be, yet,
nevertheless, now and then, like every other exanthematous
malady, asserts its character by an unusual
exhibition of virulence.”</p>


<h3>VACCINAL FATALITIES.</h3>

<p>Here we have Vaccinia defined as disease with precautions
for its safe reception; yet withal it is allowed it
may assert itself with virulence. But where do we find
any precautions exercised in the vaccination of the poor?&mdash;that
is to say, of the vast majority. Precautions are
not only disregarded, they are unknown, they are impracticable.
Infants of all sorts and conditions are
operated on as recklessly as sheep are marked. Whether
they live or die is matter of official indifference, whilst
each is warrant for an official fee. Sir Joseph Pease,
speaking in the House of Commons, said, “The President
of the Local Government Board cannot deny that children
die under the operation of the Vaccination Acts in
a wholesale way.” Vaccination conveys an acute specific
disease (having a definite course to run like smallpox
or other fever) which, whether by careless treatment, or
superinduced, or latent disease, is frequently attended
with serious and fatal issues. Hence it is that vaccination
is dreaded and detested by the poor on whom it is
inflicted without parley or mitigation; in itself a bearer
of illness, it is likewise a cruel aggravation of weakness
and illness. When the poor complain that their children
are injured or slain by vaccination, they are officially informed
they are mistaken. Dr. Stevens, a well-known
familiar of the vaccination office, says he has seen more
vaccination than any man, and has yet to witness the
least injury from the practice. Variolators used to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
the same of their practice until vaccinators arose and
convicted them of lying. Coroner Lankester held that
vaccination was not a cause of death “recognised by law,”
and was therefore an impossible cause. Such prevarication
is mockery. True it is that, if a child dies of vaccination,
it dies of erysipelas, or pyœmia, or diarrhœa,
and it is easy enough to ignore the primary cause and
assert the secondary; but I would ask, How else can
death ensue from vaccination than by erysipelas, pyœmia,
diarrhœa, or similar sequelæ? If vaccination kills a
child, how otherwise could it kill? Even should death
occur directly from surgical shock, it would be said, the
child did not die of vaccination, but from lack of vigour
to sustain a trivial operation. The Sangrado of the
Stevens pattern is never without a shuffle.</p>


<h3>VACCINIA MODIFIED IN ITS RECIPIENTS.</h3>

<p>It is usual at coroners’ inquests on vaccination fatalities
to produce children vaccinated at the same time
from the same vaccinifer, and to assert that inasmuch as
they have made good recoveries, it is impossible that the
virus was at fault, and that something else than vaccination
must have been the cause of death. The argument
often impresses a jury, but it is grossly fallacious. Suppose
a mad dog bit six men, and that five escaped injury
beyond their wounds and fright, and that one died of
rabies, would the escape of the five prove that the death
of the sixth was unconnected with the dog? Or suppose
an equal potion of gin were administered to six infants,
one of whom died and five recovered, would the recovery
of the five prove that gin did not kill the sixth? Mr.
Stoker writes to the newspapers that he vaccinated
twelve other persons with the virus he used for Miss
Ellen Terry, and that as no untoward symptoms appeared
in the twelve, therefore Miss Terry’s whitlow had no
connection with her vaccination&mdash;and this in spite of the
untoward symptoms falling due at the very time that
vaccination accounted for them! Any reasons are good
for those disposed to be convinced, and who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
settled it in their minds that vaccination is invariably
harmless.</p>

<p>No doubt there is virus used for vaccination that is
virulent beyond other virus, as there is virus that is comparatively
innocuous; but, as Dr. Mead observed more
than a century ago, “It is more material into what kind
of body smallpox is infused than out of what it is
taken.” The same virus that one constitution may
throw off with little effort, may induce disease and death
in another. Dr. Joseph Jones, president of the Louisiana
Board of Health, relates that “In many cases occurring
in the Confederate Army, the deleterious effects of vaccination
were clearly referable to the condition of the
forces, and the constitution of the blood of the patients;
for it was observed in a number of instances that the
same lymph from a healthy infant inoculated upon
different individuals produced different result’s corresponding
to the state of the system; in those who were
well fed and robust, producing no ill-effects, whilst
in the soldiers who had been subjected to incessant
fatigue, exposure, and poor diet, the gravest results
followed.”</p>

<p>Some constitutions are peculiarly liable to injury from
vaccine virus, just as some constitutions cannot endure
drugs that others receive without inconvenience. Thus
it is that fatalities from vaccination are frequent in certain
families. Of these, neither the law nor medical men
condescend to take account. Parents often plead in vain
for exemption from the rite on the ground that they have
already had children injured or slain by its performance;
the brutal and unscientific argument running, “How can
vaccination hurt your children when it does not hurt
other people’s children?”</p>


<h3>VACCINIA <span class="fs80"><em>PLUS</em></span> OTHER DISEASE.</h3>

<p>Nor is the case against vaccination yet complete. The
virus used is not only Vaccinia, but more than Vaccinia;
for it is impossible to propagate virus from child to child
without taking up other qualities. This was clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
foreseen by the variolators when vaccination was introduced&mdash;<em>they</em>
making it a point to take smallpox for
inoculation from <em>known</em> and <em>sound</em> subjects. They
maintained that cowpox transferred indiscriminately
from arm to arm <em>must</em> acquire and convey constitutional
taints; and their prognostication was speedily and
grievously fulfilled in the item of syphilis. Notwithstanding,
the fact was furiously contested. It was said
that parents used vaccination as a screen for their own
wickedness; and assertion alternated with denial even to
our own day. At last the conflict is at an end. The
evidence has grown too multitudinous and deadly for
evasion. The invaccination of syphilis is admitted, and
any question is reserved for the degree of frequency.
Some are pleased to describe the risk as infinitesimal,
but their pleasure stands for nothing but itself. Deeds
are expressive beyond words. The wide resort to animal
vaccination on the Continent and in the United States
has but one interpretation. Doctors and patients do not
abandon what is easy for what is troublesome, nor incur
the risk of the communication of bovine disorders unless
under the influence of over-mastering terror.</p>


<h3>STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF EXTRA DISEASE.</h3>

<p>Relations of individual experience may be disregarded
as untrustworthy, but the broad evidence of national
statistics conveys authoritative lessons. Vaccination in
England was made compulsory in 1853, stringently so
in 1867, and systematically extended to the entire
population. If therefore it were true that vaccination
often communicates more than Vaccinia, and that it
aggravates existent and excites latent disease, the proof
must be manifest in the statistics of the Registrar-General.
Thus argued Mr. C. H. Hopwood, and accordingly he
moved in the House of Commons successively for three
Returns, published as follows&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vaccination, Mortality</span>,
No. 433, 1877; <span class="smcap">Mortality (General and Infant)</span>, No.
76, 1880; and <span class="smcap">Deaths (England and Wales)</span>, No. 392,
1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span></p>

<p>These Returns, charged with curious and authentic
information, are little known, and have been treated
with significant silence by the press. Obscurantism is
not confined to ecclesiastics. Our valiant journalists
who mock at the Index Expurgatorius, and abhor the
Russian censorship, are in their little way as ready to
act the same part in favour of established prejudice. If
facts adverse to the public confidence in vaccination are
revealed, it is considered no more than decent to keep
them out of sight.</p>

<p>What then is the evidence of Mr. Hopwood’s Returns?
Briefly this: they clearly illustrate that vaccination does
produce, intensify, excite and inoculate disease whose
issue is death. The record of infant mortality from
fifteen specified diseases related to vaccination stands
thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus, while the population of England and Wales had
increased from 18 to 23 millions, the deaths of infants
from fifteen diseases had risen from 63,000 to 106,000.
Had the mortality kept pace with the population, the
deaths in 1875 would only have been 80,000; that is to
say, in 1875 there perished in England 26,000 infants
who would have lived had vaccination remained as little
in vogue as in 1847! The result though startling in the
gross is precisely what might have been predicted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
infancy of a country cannot be systematically diseased,
that is vaccinated, without exciting and aggravating
other maladies, and thereby enlarging the harvest of
death.</p>


<h3>VACCINIA AGGRAVATES DISEASE.</h3>

<p>The asserted connection of vaccination with other
ailments, such as bronchitis, sometimes gives occasion
to ignorant ridicule. “Bronchitis,” says Sir Lyon
Playfair, “has about the same relation to vaccination as
the Goodwin Sands have to Tenterden Steeple.” The
answer is that the debility produced by vaccination predisposes
to affections of the respiratory organs. The
human body does not consist of isolated compartments,
but is an organised whole, sympathetic in all its parts and
functions. Erysipelas, as we have seen, is the primary
symptom of inoculated Vaccinia, and diarrhœa is its
commonest sequence; and given erysipelas and diarrhœa,
what vigour may remain to assist and throw off other
ailments? It is not said that certain maladies are communicated
by vaccination, but that vaccination contributes
to their fatality. An infant that would have
survived bronchitis dies of bronchitis <em>and</em> vaccination;
dies of teething <em>and</em> vaccination; dies of convulsions
<em>and</em> vaccination; dies of whooping-cough <em>and</em> vaccination;
and so on. Again disease kindles disease, and
many a child might outgrow congenital scrofula or
phthisis if the latent disorder were not roused by vaccination.
For these reasons no doubt need be entertained
that were vaccination abolished, the event would be
immediately signalised by an extraordinary fall in infant
mortality.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN OF COMPULSORY VACCINATION.</h3>

<p>If vaccination were a voluntary superstition, its prevalence
would be sufficiently deplorable; but when we
think of it as inflicted on the nation, and pressed on
those who know it for an injurious imposture, language
is apt to arise which it is expedient to repress. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
be asked how it came to pass that legislation was ever
compromised with a medical prescription, and the answer
is not a reassuring one. The initial error was the endowment
in 1808 of the National Vaccine Establishment,
and the provision of vaccination fees in 1840 out of the
poor rate. For the enforcement of vaccination, there
never was any popular demand&mdash;never the slightest.
The public had, however, learnt from sanitarians that a
large part of the sickness from which they suffered did
not come of fate, but was preventible; and under this
novel persuasion the vast expenditure on sanitary works
during the past fifty years has been cheerfully incurred.
Availing themselves of this favourable disposition in the
public mind toward projects in the name of health,
certain medical place-hunters operating as the Epidemiological
Society contrived to gain the ear of Government
and to pass a compulsory Vaccination Act in 1853. The
politicians who lent themselves to this transaction disowned
any knowledge of vaccination. They acted, they
said, under medical advice, and ran the bill through
Parliament with little resistance. The Act did not
personally concern M.P.’s. If they happened to believe
in vaccination, their children received the rite with all
recognised precautions. Its enforced application by contract
at 1s. or 1s. 6d. per head was reserved for the
unenfranchised and unconsulted multitude; whilst the
administration of the Act provided place and pay for its
ingenious promoters.</p>


<h3>RESISTANCE, INFLEXIBLE RESISTANCE.</h3>

<p>When an oppressive law is enacted, by whatever
strategy or however corruptly, its repeal is no easy
matter. The oppressors have won the nine points of
possession. The antagonists of the Vaccination Acts
nevertheless possess a certain advantage. Some bad laws
can only be denounced as it were from a distance; but
vaccination touches every household, and can be fought
wherever a child is claimed as a victim for the rite.</p>

<p>We abhor the rite. We detest it as an imposture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
We dread it as a danger. We refuse it on any terms. We
encourage, we justify, we insist on the duty of rejection.
Our contention extends and prospers. In various parts
of the country resistance has been rewarded with success.
The evil law has been broken down. Freedom has been
recovered and freedom is enjoyed. In other parts the
struggle for liberty proceeds, and as it proceeds, light is
diffused and courage evoked for enlarged resistance.
Elsewhere there are vindictive and cruel prosecutions,
chiefly of humble folk. “Respected ratepayers,” to whom
the law is objectionable and its penalties trivial annoyances,
are discreetly passed over. Hard, however, is the
lot of poor men, who for love of their children affront
the dull animosity and ignorance of English Philistines
whether as guardians or as magistrates on the bench of
injustice. Shortly co-operation for defence and insurance
against fines will enable the feeblest and most fearful to
maintain his integrity and encounter his pursuers with
undaunted front. Parliament, as our statesmen allow,
is deaf to the aggrieved until they make themselves intolerable,
and to raise ourselves to that pitch must be
our end and aim.</p>


<h3>COMPULSORY EDUCATION AND VACCINATION.</h3>

<p>Many good people are distressed over the operation of
this extraordinary law, and sometimes in their perplexity
adventure for excuse, “Surely since we compel parents
to educate their children, it cannot be wrong to compel
them to have their children vaccinated.”</p>

<p>We answer, education is compulsory so far as it is
outside conscience. Compulsion is designed to overcome
parental indifference and selfishness: where it confronts
serious convictions it is arrested. By general consent
the most important part of education is religion; and
religion is precisely that part of education which is
exempted from compulsion. The law does not even
enforce <em>some</em> form of religion, so that parents who regard
religion as superfluous may not be aggrieved.</p>

<p>What therefore the opponents of vaccination demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
is, that the respect thus accorded to the religious
conscience be extended to the scientific conscience&mdash;to
those who are convinced that vaccination does not prevent
smallpox or is an injurious practice. Even allowing
it to be a harmless ceremony, resistance would be justifiable.
It would be in vain to console a Baptist, forced to
convey his child to the parish font, with the assurance
that a few drops of water could do no harm. It is not
in human nature to submit to the indignity of imposture;
and to thousands of Englishmen vaccination is a cruel
and degrading imposture, and to punish them for their
loyalty to what they think right is every whit as tyrannical
as it was for Catholics to persecute Protestants,
and Protestants Catholics, and Catholics and Protestants
Jews. There is no difference in the terms of intolerance;
and there is no difference in the spirit with which this
latter-day tyranny is confronted, and that spirit with
which religious liberty was vindicated and won.</p>


<h3>CONDITIONS OF THE CONFLICT.</h3>

<p>To some eyes the conflict is not only arduous; it is
hopeless; but we are of a different mind. The conflict
may prove even less arduous than it appears; and for
these reasons. The law as it stands is perfunctorily
defended. No politician answers for it without reluctance.
Many allow that a serious mistake was made
when legislation was enacted for medical advantage at
medical dictation. The Gladstone government proposed
to abolish repeated penalties. The central authorities at
the Local Government Board make no secret of the insuperable
difficulties which attend the administration of
the law. They advise concession to its resolute adversaries.
They do not reinstate the law where it has
broken down. Legislation thus discredited is sure to
collapse under broader pressure. The medical support
is still weaker; and is chiefly confined to those who
represent the trade element of the profession&mdash;men who
would defend any abuse however flagrant if established
and lucrative. It is the custom to laud the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
Jenner and the salvation he wrought, but these are words
of an old song. Those who have penetrated to the inception
of the Jennerian rite; who know the absolute
promise by which it prevailed and its absolute failure;
who have followed its successive transformations and
varieties with their respective injuries and fatalities;
who are aware of the Babel of confusion and contradiction
in which its venal practitioners are involved&mdash;these
we say recognise how impossible it is for vaccination to
be brought under discussion and survive. It is this
consciousness which accounts for the reserve of the more
prudent order of medical men. They excuse their acquiescence
in the delusion (after the manner of ecclesiastics)
by the exigencies of professional loyalty; and by the supposition
that the harm of the practice is exaggerated, whilst
it serves for the consolation of the vulgar. It is for such
reasons that we consider the conflict less arduous than it
appears. The fortifications are undermined; the bulwarks
are rotten through and through. Over all, we place
our confidence in the omnipotent favour of the truth.
Goliath, mighty and vaunting, is evermore laid low by
a smooth stone shapen in the waters of verity.</p>


<h3>A WORD FOR THE AUTHOR.</h3>

<p>The Story of this Great Delusion, I have tried to tell
concisely, keeping close to matter-of-fact, and with some
exceptions adhering to English experience. When we
venture abroad, we are apt to fall into inaccuracies and
draw unwarrantable conclusions. I am told my animus
is too pronounced, and that I should have done better
had I adopted a more judicial tone. Ah well! we should
always have done differently had we done differently.
It seems to me a man does best when he is most truly
himself; and I question whether I should have improved
my case had I tried to conceal my real mind in order to
make a more startling show of it at the close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span></p>


<h3>L’ENVOI.</h3>

<p>Lastly, a word to those who are accustomed to dismiss
opponents of vaccination as fools and fanatics. It is
related of Sydney Smith that calling on Lord Melbourne
one morning, he found his lordship in an evil temper and
cursing at large. Smith, urgent about his own affairs,
at last observed that they should take everything for
damned and proceed to business. For like reason I
would suggest that the familiar tirade of fool and fanatic
be taken as spoken, and that we proceed to discuss vaccination
and compulsory vaccination on their merits.</p>

<p class="noindent">To the Turks we owe little, and in the little is included
the practice of inducing smallpox artificially. The practice
was first brought under English attention by Emanuel
Timoni in a letter, dated Constantinople, December, 1713,
communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Woodward,
and published in the Society’s <cite>Transactions</cite> for 1714.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
About the same time, Pylarini, Venetian consul at
Smyrna, described the practice in a Latin pamphlet
printed at Venice, 1715,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and reproduced in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite> for 1716. Mr. Kennedy, an English
surgeon, who had visited Turkey, also reported the practice
under the designation of “Engrafting the Smallpox.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Timoni was a Greek physician, who had studied at
Oxford and Padua, and then established himself in Constantinople.
He described “smallpox by incision” as
having been practised in Constantinople for forty years,
and that it had been found uniformly successful in warding
off smallpox as naturally developed. The variolous
matter was usually taken from healthy boys suffering
from the spontaneous disease, and was applied to persons
of all ages and temperaments, causing them no more
than temporary and trifling inconvenience. The only
preparation requisite for incision was abstinence from
flesh and broth for twenty or twenty-five days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It so happened that when Woodward read Timoni’s
letter to the Royal Society, he at the same time produced
a selection from the correspondence of Cotton Mather of
Boston, Massachusetts&mdash;a curious jumble of facts and
fancies. Mather had been elected a Fellow of the Society,
and the selections from his correspondence, and Timoni’s
letter appeared in the same number of the <cite>Transactions</cite>,
No. 338, 1714.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather is one of the marvels of biography&mdash;a
choice specimen of Puritanism developed without check.
He was a man of boundless energy and incessant industry,
of intense piety and unlimited self-confidence; and
thus, without hesitation, he set himself to extirpate
witchcraft, shrinking from no atrocity, until the frightful
Salem tragedy of 1692 shocked the colony into mercy
and common-sense.</p>

<p>Mather was just the sort of character to be impressed
with Timoni’s description of the short and easy way with
smallpox; and he who had hanged warlocks and witches
with sublime assurance, was not likely to have scruples
about inoculating the community when inwardly satisfied
it was for the public good. The audacity and tyranny of
conscientious conceit are proverbial. He had, however,
to exercise patience in awaiting an opportunity to test
the Turkish remedy, for there had been no smallpox
in Boston for nineteen years&mdash;a fact worth noting by
those who imagine smallpox was an omnipresent ailment
until the advent of Edward Jenner. In 1721 a serious
outbreak occurred, the deaths rising in October to 100 a
week in a population of 15,000. Mather convoked a
meeting of physicians, and laid before them the new prescription,
but they would not listen to it. Dr. Boylston,
however, was persuaded, and inoculated two of his slaves,
and then his sons, aged five and six; whereon he was
summoned before the justices and severely reprimanded.
Undeterred by the State, and supported by the Church,
he persevered, and by the end of September had inoculated
80, and by the middle of December, 250.</p>

<p>His custom was to make a couple of incisions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
arms, into which bits of lint dipped in pox-matter were
inserted. At the end of twenty-four hours the lint was
withdrawn, and the wounds dressed with warm cabbage
leaves. On the seventh day the patient sickened and
pustules appeared, sometimes few, sometimes hundreds.
Mather and Boylston maintained it was a most wholesome
operation, for after it “feeble, crazy, consumptive
people, grew hearty, and got rid of their former
maladies.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To be poxed was to be rejuvenated.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather’s own account of the Boston experiment
is worth reading. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</span>.</p>

<p>The distemper hath lately visited and ransacked the City of
Boston; and in little more than half a year, of more than 5000
persons that have undergone it, near 900 have died. But how
many lives might have been saved if our unhappy physicians had
not poisoned and bewitched our people with a blind rage that it
has appeared very like a Satanick Possession against the method
of relief and safety in the way of the smallpox inoculated!</p>

<p>I have prevailed with one physician (and for it I have had bloody
attempts made upon my life by some of our Energumens) to introduce
the practice; and the experiment has been made upon almost
300 Objects in our neighbourhood, young and old (from one year
to seventy), weak and strong, male and female, white and black,
in midsummer, autumn, and winter, and it succeeds to admiration!</p>

<p>I cannot learn that one has died of it; though the experiment
has been made under various and marvellous disadvantages. Five
or six have died upon it, or after it, but from other diseases or accidents;
chiefly from having taken infection in the common way by
inspiration before it could be given in this way by transplantation.</p>

<p>Dr. Leigh, in his <cite>Natural History of Lancashire</cite>, counts it an
occurrence worth relating, that there were some catts known to
catch the smallpox, and pass regularly through the state of it, and
then to die. We have had among us the very same occurrence.</p>

<p>It was generally observed and complained that the pigeon-houses
of the City continued unfruitful, and the pigeons did not hatch or
lay as they used to do all the while that the smallpox was in its
epidemical progress: and it is very strongly affirmed that our dunghill
fowl felt much of the like effect upon them.</p>

<p>We have many among us who have been visited with the Plague
in other countries many years ago, who have never been arrested
with smallpox after it, though they have been exposed as much as
any other people to it; whence the belief now begins to prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
among us, that they who have had the Plague will never have the
smallpox after it.</p></div>

<p>Considering the developed evidence that awaits us as
to the character and results of inoculation, it would be
superfluous to discuss this singular report, but we may
remark the consummate audacity with which Mather
assumes and maintains his position. What a masterly
touch of the quack have we in these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot learn that one has died of it. Five or six have died
upon it, or after it, but from other diseases or accidents; chiefly
from having taken infection in the common way by inspiration
before it could be given in the way of transplantation.</p></div>

<p>We can readily understand how the hand that could
give so adroit a turn to awkward disasters could in other
days frame irresistible indictments for witchcraft.</p>

<p>The precise truth as to the extent of the Boston epidemic
is far from easy to ascertain: it was the temptation
of the inoculators to magnify the numbers of the afflicted
and of their antagonists to minimise. Thus we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At a meeting by publick authority in the Town House of Boston,
before His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace and the Select Men;
the practitioners of physic and surgery being called before them,
concerning Inoculation, agreed to the following conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Resolve upon a debate held by the physicians of Boston concerning
inoculating the Smallpox on the 21st day of July, 1721.</p>

<p>It appears by numerous instances, that it has proved the death
of many persons soon after the operation, and brought distempers
upon many others which have in the end proved deadly to ’em.</p>

<p>That the natural tendency of infusing such malignant filth in
the mass of blood is to corrupt and putrefy it, and if there be not a
sufficient discharge of that malignity by the place of incision, or
elsewhere, it lays a foundation for many dangerous diseases.</p>

<p>That the operation tends to spread and continue the infection in
a place longer than it might otherwise be.</p>

<p>That the continuing the operation among us is likely to prove of
most dangerous consequence.</p>

<p>The number of persons, men, women, and children, that have
died of smallpox at Boston from the middle of April last (being
brought here then by the Saltertuda’s Fleet) to the 23rd of this
instant July (being the hottest and worst season of the year to have
any distemper in) are, <em>viz.</em>&mdash;2 men, strangers, 3 men, 3 young men,
2 women, 4 children, 1 negro man, and 1 Indian woman, 17 in all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and of those that have had it, some are well recovered, and others
in a hopeful and fair way of recovery.</p>

<p class="right smcap">By the Select Men of the Town of Boston.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Fleuart of Boston wrote to London that of 70
inoculated, 14 or 15 had died; and that at Roxbury,
where there was no smallpox, 5 inoculated had died.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Conflicting as are the testimonies, we must allow much
to the natural aversion from an operation, not only novel,
but disgusting; but taking the best that could be claimed
for the new practice by an enthusiastic advocate, the
benefit was trifling when seriously scrutinised. Dr.
Boylston visited London after the Boston epidemic, and
finding inoculation in high vogue he published an
<cite>Account of the Smallpox inoculated in New England</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
George I. and the Prince and Princess of Wales had
taken Inoculation under their august patronage, and
Boylston with loyal fervour burst forth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shall not physicians and surgeons recommend and bring it into
greater esteem and practice, and save (under God) thousands and
tens of thousands by it; and make further improvements in it;
and set more vigorously about it when they consider their great
Pattern and Example for it, namely, the greatest and wisest of
Kings, their royal highnesses the Prince and Princess at the head
of it; and that it has been used upon their Royal Issue with great
success?</p></div>

<p>Boylston in his <cite>Account</cite> recites his cases with, we
think, general veracity. He performed 244 inoculations,
and says, “there were in the towns near Boston about
36 persons more inoculated, which all did well; namely,
by Dr. Roby about 11, and by Dr. Thomson about 25,
which, together with my 244, make up the number of
280; out of which number died only 6 persons, notwithstanding
all the difficulties the practice laboured under.”</p>

<p>Beyond measure extraordinary was the bland assurance
wherewith Boylston, in common with Mather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
others, assumed and argued that the 280 inoculated had
been thereby delivered from the plague of smallpox and
death. Accepting the improbable supposition that the
280 were a fair average of 15,000 Bostonians, of whom
one-third took smallpox, we have to abstract two-thirds
of the 280, or 186 as superfluously inoculated, leaving 93
saved from smallpox. If we then inquire how many
of these were saved from death, and resort to Boylston’s
statistics, who says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1721 and beginning of 1722 there were in Boston 5759 persons
who had smallpox in the natural way, out of which number died
844; so that the proportion that die of natural smallpox appears
to be one in six, or between that of six and seven&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>We find the number no more than 15, from which, if
we deduct the 6 who died under his hand, his trophies
are reduced to 9, to save whom he put 280 into serious
sickness and jeopardy&mdash;so serious indeed in some instances
(as appears from his own notes) that there was
slight reason to prefer inoculated to spontaneous smallpox.</p>

<p>Viewed thus in his own light&mdash;a light most favourable,
how vain, not to say impudent, was such boasting
as this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, if there be any one that can find a faithful account or
history of any other method or practice that has carried such a
number of all ages, sexes, constitutions, and colours, and in the
worst seasons of the year, through the smallpox; or indeed
through any other acute distemper with better success, then I will
alter my opinion of this; and until then, I shall value and esteem
this method of inoculating the smallpox as the most beneficial
and successful that ever was discovered to, and practised by mankind
in this world.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p>And, gaining courage through his own noise, he went
yet farther, and proclaimed that smallpox was tamed
and subdued&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is, and shall be acknowledged, to the praise and glory of
God, that whereas a most wild, cruel, fierce and violent distemper,
and which has destroyed millions of lives, is now (by that happy

<p>In the knowledge of the emptiness of this bounce, it
may seem malicious to withdraw it from forgetfulness;
but it serves to point the truth that human nature in
1726 was much the same as human nature at this day,
and that the same arts of audacious assertion and rowdy
rhetoric were in practice then as now. Indeed, whoever
is sufficiently wicked to presume on the natural
trustfulness of mankind, and will lie loud enough and
long enough, may attain an appalling success&mdash;as our
story, alas! will prove.</p>

<p>One thing goes to Boylston’s credit: he did not propose
to make poxing universal&mdash;to poison and sicken
everybody, and inflict certain injury to avert future and
uncertain danger from a few. He proposed to reserve
inoculation for emergencies&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the smallpox left Boston, inoculation ceased; and when
it shall please Providence to send and spread that distemper among
us again, may inoculation revive, be better received, and continued
a blessing in preserving many from misery, corruption and death.</p></div>

<p>The narratives of Mather and Boylston are of special
importance because we have in them the true lineage of
inoculation as introduced from the eastern to the western
world. Boylston tells us that when smallpox appeared
in Boston&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Mather, in compassion to the lives of the people, transcribed
from the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> of the Royal Society the
accounts sent them by Dr. Timonius and Pylarinus of inoculating
the smallpox in the Levant, and sent them to the practitioners of
the town for their consideration thereon.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></div>

<p>For some inscrutable reason the true position of Cotton
Mather in the history of inoculation is continually overlooked
or mis-stated. For instance, in Mather’s biography
in the excellent <cite>English Cyclopædia</cite>, it is said that he
derived his information and impulse from the letters of
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; a statement repeated in
the memoirs of that lady, which is entirely fabulous.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">“As for History,” said the Duke of Marlborough, “I know
that it is false;” and whoever has occasion to enter
minutely into any historical question will be apt to
concur with the Duke. Happening to refer to Walter
Bagehot’s essay on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, I found
this passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She brought from Turkey the notion of inoculation. Like most
improvers, she was roughly spoken to. Medical men were angry
because the practice was not in their books, and conservative men
were cross at the agony of a new idea. Religious people considered
it wicked to have a disease which Providence did not think fit to
send you; and simple people “did not like to make themselves ill
of their own accord.” She triumphed, however, over all obstacles;
inoculation, being really found to lengthen life and save complexions,
before long became general.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p>Now Bagehot loved accuracy and abhorred credulity;
and yet in these lines, delivered with as much confidence
as a column of the multiplication table, there are exhibited
about as much inaccuracy and credulity as could
be packed into the space. Let us see what Lady Mary
really did in the matter of inoculation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wortley Montagu was appointed ambassador to
the Porte, and set out for Constantinople in the autumn
of 1716 accompanied by his wife, then in her twenty-seventh
year. The Ottoman Empire was in those days
powerful and proud, disdaining to send representatives
to Christian Courts, and receiving ambassadors as commercial
agents, or as bearers of homage from their respective
sovereigns. The English ambassador reached his
destination early in 1717, and ere a month had passed,
and ere Lady Mary had time to look around and appreciate
the strange world into which she had entered, with
sprightly audacity she wrote as follows to her friend
Miss Sarah Chiswell&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am going to tell you a thing that I am sure will make you wish
yourself here. The smallpox, so fatal, and so general amongst us,
is here entirely harmless by the invention of <em>ingrafting</em>, which is
the term they give it. There is a set of old women who make it
their business to perform the operation every autumn, in the month
of September, when the great heat is abated. People send to one
another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the
smallpox: they make parties for this purpose, and when they are
met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes
with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of smallpox, and
asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately
rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you
no more pain than a common scratch), and puts into the vein as
much venom as can lie upon the head of her needle, and after
binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell; and in this
manner opens four or five veins. The Grecians have commonly
the superstition of opening one in the middle of the forehead, in
each arm, and on the breast, to mark the sign of the cross; but
this has a very ill effect, all these wounds leaving little scars, and
is not done by those that are not superstitious, who choose to have
them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The
children or young patients play together all the rest of the day,
and are in perfect health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to
seize them, and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three.
They have very rarely above twenty or thirty [pustules] in their
faces, which never mark; and in eight days’ time they are as well
as before their illness. Where they are wounded, there remain
running sores during the distemper, which I don’t doubt is a great
relief to it. Every year thousands undergo this operation; and the
French ambassador says pleasantly that they take the smallpox
here by way of diversion, as they take the waters in other countries.
There is no example of any one that has died in it; and you may
believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of the experiment,
since I intend to try it on my dear little son.</p>

<p>I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention
into fashion in England; and I should not fail to write to some of
our doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them
that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable
branch of their revenue for the good of mankind. But that distemper
is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment
the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it.
Perhaps, if I live to return, I may, however, have courage to war
with them. Upon this occasion admire the heroism in the heart
of your friend.</p></div>

<p>In this letter there was material for a smallpox idyl&mdash;nothing
easier, nothing surer, “smallpox made entirely
harmless.” But idyls are deceptive; their paradisiacal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
effects are obtained by the sedulous exclusion of whatever
is otherwise. About the time that Lady Mary was
romancing so triumphantly to Miss Sarah Chiswell she
despatched this note to her husband&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Sunday, 23rd March, 1717-18.</p>

<p>The boy<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was engrafted last Tuesday, and is at this time singing
and playing, and very impatient for his supper. I pray God my
next may give as good an account of him.... I cannot engraft
the girl; her nurse has not had the smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Why should the engrafting of the infant have been
hindered because the nurse had not had smallpox? The
answer to the question reveals a peril concealed from Miss
Sarah Chiswell. Because the engrafted child would probably
have communicated unmitigated smallpox to the
nurse. Why not then engraft nurse and child? Because
they would have sickened together, and mother Mary did
not care to incur the risk. There was no danger, she said;
none whatever, only a pleasant diversion; nevertheless
she preferred discretion to her own voluble assurance.</p>

<p>In History we have always to suspect the picturesque,
for mankind have a fatal preference for handsome error
over uncomely fact; and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu
as mother of English inoculation, and derivatively of
vaccination, is ever so much more graceful than dull
Timoni and Pylarini in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>,
or Cotton Mather in New England. Few condescend to
inquire whether Lady Mary, as primary inoculator, was
acting independently, or whether she had advisers and
prompters. “All of her self and by her self” is the heroic
representation&mdash;“a woman’s wit against the world;” and
judgment surrenders to fancy, as is the way with myths
ancient and modern.</p>

<p>But it so happens that what in itself ought to be incredible&mdash;that
a young Englishwoman should suddenly
adopt the strange practice of a strange people&mdash;is
demonstrably incredible. Lady Mary did not act alone.
She had for counsellor and director, Charles Maitland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the physician to the embassy, who, familiar with the
fame of inoculation, was glad to observe its practice
experimentally. Maitland writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the year 1717, when I had the honour to attend the English
Ambassador and his family at Constantinople, I had a fair opportunity
fully to inform myself <em>of what I had long before heard</em>,
namely, the famous practice of transplanting, or raising the smallpox
by inoculation.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>Here we may note, too, that Maitland was aware that
inoculation did not originate in Turkey. He says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whilst universally practised all over Turkey for three-score years
past, it has been known in other parts of the East, a hundred, or,
for aught we know, some hundreds of years before.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>It was Maitland who managed the inoculation of young
Montagu, and he thus described the operation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About this time, the Ambassador’s ingenious lady resolved to
submit her only son to it, a very hopeful boy of about six years of
age. She first of all ordered me to find out a fit subject to take the
matter from, and then sent for an old Greek woman who had practised
this way a great many years. After a good deal of trouble
and pains, I found a proper subject, and then the good woman
went to work; but so awkwardly by the shaking of her hand, and
put the child to so much torture with her blunt and rusty needle,
that I pitied his cries, who had ever been of such spirit and courage
that hardly anything of pain could make him cry before; and,
therefore, inoculated the other arm with my own instrument, and
with so little pain to him that he did not in the least complain of
it. The operation took in both arms, and succeeded perfectly
well.... He had about an hundred pox all upon his body. This
operation was performed at Pera in the month of March, 1717.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">That is to say, almost simultaneously with the Ambassador’s
arrival in Turkey.</p>

<p>The embassy returned to England in 1718, after a
residence of little over a year in Constantinople. The
dates are worth observation; for whilst it appears that
the doctor and the lady were in common resolved to recommend
the practice of inoculation to their countrymen,
the dates prove with what inexperience and levity they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
assumed the grave responsibility. If quackery be assertion
in absence of knowledge or of evidence, then we
may accurately stigmatise Maitland and Montagu a couple
of quacks. But so far as concerns Maitland we may go
farther, for he expressly tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was assured and saw with my eyes that the smallpox is rather
more malignant and epidemic in the Turkish dominions than with
us; insomuch that, as some have affirmed, one-half, or at least one-third
part of the diseased, at certain times, do die of it; and they
that escape are terribly disfigured by it.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>Yet this same Maitland, who thus testified of the impotence
of inoculation to mitigate and restrain smallpox
in Turkey, came to England ready to assert its power to
mitigate and restrain! It is difficult to find words of
due severity for such impudent inconsistency. We shall
see, however, in the course of this wonderful story, how
every rule of evidence may be defied in the matter of
smallpox, and how it is possible to shut one’s eyes and
prophesy in the name of science, and have noise and
hardihood accepted for veracity.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">MAITLAND’S EXPERIMENTS.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu returned to England in
1718, but not until 1721 did she fulfil her intention of
making war on the doctors, and incurring their resentment
for the good of mankind. In the spring of 1721
she commenced action in earnest by the inoculation of
her daughter&mdash;the infant that it was considered unsafe to
“engraft” when at Pera in 1718. In Maitland’s words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The noble Lady sent for me last April, and when I came, she
told me she was now resolved to have her daughter inoculated, and
desired me forthwith to find out matter for the purpose. I pleaded
for a delay of a week or two, the weather being then cold and wet.
I also prayed, that any two physicians whom she thought fit, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
be called, not only to consult the health and safety of the child,
but likewise to be eye witnesses of the practice, and contribute to
the credit and reputation of it. This was at first denied me, it
might be out of a design to keep it secret, or lest it should come to
nothing.</p>

<p>In the meantime having found proper matter, I engrafted the
child in both arms, after the usual manner. She continued easy
and well till the tenth night, when she was observed to be a little
hot and feverish. An ancient apothecary in the neighbourhood
being then called, prudently advised not to give the child medicine,
assuring the parents there was no danger, and that the heat would
quickly abate, which accordingly it did, and the smallpox began
next morning to appear. Three learned physicians of the college
were admitted, one after another, to visit the young lady; they are all
gentlemen of honour, and will on all occasions declare, as they have
done hitherto, that they saw Miss Wortley playing about the room,
cheerful and well, with the smallpox raised upon her; and that in
a few days after she perfectly recovered of them. Several ladies,
and other persons of distinction, also visited this young patient, and
can attest the truth of this fact.</p>

<p>One of the learned physicians who had visited Miss Wortley,
having some years since fully informed himself of this method of
practice, and being thoroughly satisfied of the safety and reasonableness
of it, at length resolved to try it in his own family; he had
formerly lost some children in a very malignant kind of the smallpox,
and therefore advised me to lose no time to engraft the only
son he had left. The boy (who was not quite six years of age) being
of a pretty warm and sanguine complexion, the Doctor ordered
about five ounces of blood to be taken from him; and then, in ten
days after, having found matter which he liked, I inoculated him
in both arms. This was performed the 11th of May, 1721.</p></div>

<p>The learned physician here referred to was Dr. Keith,
and the facility wherewith he adopted the novel practice
supplies an instructive commentary on Lady Mary’s anticipation
of the resentment of “the profession”&mdash;her
first imitator coming from the ranks of the dreaded self-seeking
obstructives. Furthermore, we have to observe
how different is Maitland’s account from the heroic myth
current of “the one woman confronting the prejudice and
ill-will of the world.” Even Lady Louisa Stuart, who
made it her business to correct many misconceptions as
to her grandmother’s career, writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Only the higher motive of hoping to save numberless lives could
have given Lady Mary courage to resolve upon bringing home the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
discovery. For what an arduous, what a fearful, and, we may add,
what a thankless enterprise it was, nobody is now in the least
aware. Those who have heard her applauded for it ever since they
were born, and have also seen how joyfully vaccination was welcomed
in their own days, may naturally conclude that when once
the experiment had been made, and had been proved successful,
she could have nothing to do but to sit down triumphant, and receive
the thanks and blessings of her countrymen. But it was far
otherwise.... Lady Mary protested that in four or five years
immediately succeeding her arrival at home, she seldom passed a
day without repenting of her patriotic undertaking; and she vowed
that she never would have attempted it, if she had foreseen the
vexation, the persecution, and even the obloquy it brought upon
her. The clamours raised against the practice, and of course
against her, were beyond belief. <em>The facility rose in arms to a man</em>,
foretelling failure and the most disastrous consequences; the clergy
descanted from their pulpits on the impiety of thus seeking to take
events out of the hand of Providence; the common people were
taught to look at her as an unnatural mother, who had risked the lives
of her own children.... We now read in grave medical biography
that the discovery was instantly hailed, and the method adopted,
by the principal members of the profession.... But what said Lady
Mary of the actual fact and actual time? Why, that <em>the four
great physicians deputed by Government to watch the progress of
her daughter’s inoculation</em>, betrayed not only such incredulity as
to its success, but such an unwillingness to have it succeed, such
an evident spirit of rancour and malignity, that she never cared to
leave the child alone with them one second, lest it should in some
secret way suffer from their interference.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus is History written! An apothecary and three
doctors, selected by the Wortleys at discretion, and admitted
singly to view a private experiment, are converted
into “four great physicians deputed by Government,”
rancorous and dangerous! Thus are myths generated!</p>

<p>Lady Mary was a woman of mark in society, fashionable
and literary, and her exploit was naturally the talk
of the town. Among her friends was Caroline, Princess
of Wales, a lady of more than ordinary strength of mind
and intelligence, with a taste for theology and philosophy,
the patron of Butler, and his sympathetic student. It
has been said, “There never was a clever woman that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was not a quack;” and Princess Caroline was an illustration
of its truth. The new remedy for smallpox caught
her fancy, and she determined to put it to the test. She
begged of George I. that six felons should be pardoned
on condition of their submission to inoculation, and the
King was pleased to comply with the extraordinary request.
Maitland was then called upon to exhibit his skill,
but he hesitated to act as hangman’s substitute; whereon
Sir Hans Sloane, the court physician, was appealed to.
Sir Hans held counsel with Dr. Terry of Enfield, who
had practised physic in Constantinople, and knew something
of inoculation; and fortified with Terry’s assurance,
he was enabled to overcome Maitland’s scruples, real or
affected. Accordingly, on the 9th of August, 1721, writes
Maitland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I performed the operation of inoculating the smallpox on six
condemned criminals at Newgate in presence of several eminent
physicians, surgeons, and others. The names of the criminals

<p>On Wednesday morning, 9th August, he made incisions
in both arms and the right legs of the six. Thursday
passed and Friday passed without any indications of
constitutional disturbance, and, despairing of success, he
obtained fresh pox on Saturday from Christ’s Hospital,
and repeated the inoculation in new incisions in the arms
of five of them. He had no matter left for Evans, who,
it appeared, had had smallpox in September, 1720, and
who therefore escaped hanging unwarrantably. The
disease now “took,” and progressed satisfactorily. Says
Maitland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One day Mr. Cook, an eminent Turkey merchant, having seen
the persons engrafted in Newgate, and having fully considered
their incisions and eruptions, he openly declared they were the
very same as he had observed in Turkey, having seen a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
instances; and that we might be assured they would never again
be infected with smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Mead suggested another experiment&mdash;that cotton
dipped in pox should be inserted in the nostrils; and a
young woman sentenced to death received her life on
condition of submitting to the operation. Here we have
Mead’s own account of the transaction&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A learned author has given an account of the practice of sowing
smallpox, as they call it, known to the Chinese above three hundred
years, which is this. They take the skins of some of the dried
pustules, which are fallen from the body, and put them into a
porcelain bottle, stopping the mouth of it very close with wax.
When they have a mind to infect any one, they make up three or
four of these skins, putting between them with one grain of musk
into a tent with cotton, which they put up the nostrils.</p>

<p>I myself have had an opportunity of making an experiment to
this purpose. For, when in the year 1721, by order of his Sacred
Majesty, both for the sake of his own family, and of his subjects, a
trial was to be made upon seven condemned malefactors, whether
or not the smallpox could safely be communicated by inoculation;
I easily obtained leave to make the Chinese experiment in one of
them. There was among those who were chosen out to undergo
the operation, a young girl of eighteen years of age. I put into
her nostrils a tent, wetted with matter taken out of ripe pustules.
The event answered: for she, in like manner with the others, who
were infected by incisions made in the skin, fell sick, and recovered;
but suffered much more than they did, being, immediately after
the poison was received into the nose, miserably tormented with
sharp pains in her head, and a fever, which never left her till the
eruption of the pustules.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>Finally, says Maitland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the 6th of September they were all dismissed to their several
counties and habitations. The thing has been successful on all the
five, far beyond my expectation, considering their age, habit of
body, and circumstances; and it has perfectly answered Dr.
Timoni’s account of the practice, and also the experience of all
who have seen it in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>So Maitland asserted, but others were of a different
opinion. Dr. Wagstaffe, who visited the patients in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Newgate regularly, maintained in a letter addressed to
Dr. Freind&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon the whole, Sir, in the cases mentioned, there was nothing
like the smallpox, either in symptoms, appearances, advance of the
pustules, or the course of the distemper. And it would puzzle any
one to conceive how it is possible that smallpox can ever be prevented
by inoculation. With the exception of one of the men, the
girl who had cotton dipped in matter thrust up her nostrils, had as
fair a smallpox as any in the place.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir Hans Sloane and Dr. Steigertahl, physician to the
King, to test the matter farther, “joined purses,” and
had one of the women inoculated in Newgate sent to
Hertford, where smallpox of a severe form was prevalent,
to lie in bed with smallpox patients. This she did with
impunity; but it was reasonably objected that many who
were not inoculated did so likewise and escaped without
harm.</p>

<p>The Newgate experiment, of course, caused great excitement,
and induced many repetitions in town and
country. The Princess of Wales was especially alive to
the importance of “the great discovery;” and for her
additional satisfaction, six charity children, belonging to
the parish of St. James, were inoculated; and all but one
“took” and did well; the exception being due to the
craft of the child, who, for the sake of the reward, concealed
the fact of having had smallpox.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon these trials, and several others in private families [wrote
Sir Hans Sloane], the Princess of Wales sent for me to ask my
opinion of the inoculation of the Princesses. I told Her Royal
Highness, that by what appeared in the several essays, it seemed
to be a method to secure people from the great dangers attending
smallpox in the natural way. That preparations by diet and
necessary precautions being taken, made the practice very desirable;
but that not being certain of the consequences which might
happen, I would not persuade nor advise the making trials upon
patients of such importance to the public. The Princess then
asked me if I would dissuade her from it: to which I made answer
that I would not, in a matter so likely to be of such advantage.
Her reply was, that she was then resolved to have it done, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ordered me to go to the King, who commanded me to wait upon
him on the occasion. I told his Majesty my opinion, that it was
impossible to be certain, but that raising such a commotion in
the blood there might happen dangerous accidents not foreseen:
but he replied that such might and had happened to persons who
had lost their lives by bleeding in a pleurisy, and taking physic in
any distemper, let never so much care be taken. I told his Majesty
that I thought this to be the same case, and the matter was
concluded upon, and succeeded as usual, without any danger during
the operation, or the least ill symptom or disorder since.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></div>

<p>The Princess Amelia, aged eleven, and Caroline, aged
nine, were therefore inoculated on the 19th of April, 1722.</p>

<p>Let us return to Maitland, whose triumph for the
moment appeared complete, and with it his assurance.
To his detractors he professed boldly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I could bring a great many cases of persons inoculated in Turkey
to prove <em>the constant and certain success of the practice</em>; in all
which I have never seen any miscarriage, except in one, which
was wholly due to the rashness and inadvertence of a surgeon at
Constantinople.</p>

<p>Is it not a matter of the greatest importance for us to know how
to prevent the mighty contagion of the smallpox, and how to preserve
our children from the violent attacks and fatal effects of it?</p></div>

<p>To divine Maitland’s character&mdash;to determine how far
he was deceiver or deceived is not easy. He obviously
made professions in vast excess of his knowledge. One
of his contemporaries writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I remember Mr. Maitland at Child’s Coffee House, when the
experiment was just begun at Newgate, was as confident and positive
of the success and security proposed by inoculation as if he
had had twenty years experience without any miscarriage, which
made those who heard him justly suspect he was more concerned
for the employ than for the success of it.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>He had not the proper craft of this conscious rogue,
for alongside his assertions of absolute competence and
safety, he set forth such confessions of ignorance and
disaster, that one is impelled to pronounce him a purblind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
enthusiast. For example, take this case, which he
published without apparently any sense of its scope&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>2nd October, 1721.</em>&mdash;After due preparation of the body, I engrafted
Mary Batt, an infant of two years and a half old, daughter of
Thomas Batt, a Quaker, living at Temple, within three miles of
Hertford. The red spots and flushings appeared on her face and
neck the fourth day; and she kept playing about well till the
seventh or eighth, when she became a little heavy and thirsty,
with a fuller and quicker pulse; then the pustules came out fresh
and full, and the incisions discharged a thick and well digested
matter. She had not above twenty in all upon her; they continued
about three or four days, then dried away and fell off, and
the child recovered perfectly.</p>

<p>Thus far all was well; <em>but what happened afterwards was, I
must own, not a little surprising to me, not having seen or observed
anything like it before</em>. The case was in short this. Six
of Mr. Batt’s domestic servants, namely, four men and two maids,
who all in their turns were wont to hug and caress this child whilst
under the operation, and the pustules were out upon her, never
suspected them to be catching, <em>nor indeed did I</em>, were all seized
with the right natural smallpox, of several and very different kinds;
for some had the round distinct sort, some the small continued,
and others the confluent; all of ’em had a great many, but especially
the last, with the usual bad symptoms, <em>and very narrowly
escaped</em>. But they all (God be thanked) did well (<em>except one maid</em>,
that would not be governed under the distemper, <em>who died of it</em>,)
and now enjoy a perfect state of health.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus at the outset, smallpox and death were the products
of inoculation&mdash;the peril to be averted was incurred
and multiplied. Yet the man who thus records his own
infamous ignorance, had the impudence in the same
pages to assert&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The practice prudently managed, is always safe and useful, and
the issue ever certain and salutary.</em><a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>Words are wasted on such reckless folly: we perceive
how true is Carlyle’s observation, “Stupidity intellectual
always means stupidity moral, as you will, with
surprise or not, discover if you look.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Maitland, we may take another leaf
from his experience. He writes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p><em>12th October, 1721.</em>&mdash;I inoculated Joseph and Benjamin, sons of
William Heath, of Hertford; the first of about seven, and the
second three years of age; both with the same matter and at the
same time: the last had a gentle and favourable kind; but the
first, namely, Joseph, being a fat, foul, gluttonous boy, who would
not be confined to the rules and directions I had strictly charged
his mother withal, as to diet and keeping warm, was taken very
ill before the eruption, and after it had a great load of the continued
small kind, but at last recovered and did well.</p>

<p>What a mighty difference is here to be observed between those
two boys! The reason of it seems to be plainly this: the younger,
who had the favourable kind, was of a clean habit, moderate appetite,
and easily governed during the whole process. The elder was
not only of a gross foul constitution, but likewise had a voracious
appetite, always eating and filling his belly with the coarsest food&mdash;as
cheese, fat country pudding, cold boiled beef, and the like,
which I saw myself as I came in by chance the third day after the
operation; nor was there any care taken to restrain or keep him
within doors in cold, windy, frosty weather; he once wet his feet
in water&mdash;insomuch that had he taken the smallpox by infection,
the world could not have saved his life. Hence it appears how
necessary it is to cleanse thoroughly foul habits before the operation,
and, withal, to keep patients to a very strict regimen under it.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>Verily, as Cobbett said, quackery is never without a
shuffle. As we shall see, inoculation came to require a
preparatory course of very strict regimen&mdash;so strict as to
be impracticable for the rank and file of the world; but
the practice was at first commended without any such
conditions. What said Maitland’s patron, Lady Mary,
in her famous letter from Adrianople?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The smallpox, so fatal and so general amongst us, is here entirely
harmless by the invention of <em>ingrafting</em>.... Every year
thousands undergo its operation; and the French ambassador says
pleasantly that they take the smallpox here by way of diversion,
as they take waters in other countries. There is no example of
anyone that has died in it.</p></div>

<p>It was under cover of such seductive assurances that
inoculation was introduced to England, and established
in perversity and quackery.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE FIRST OPPONENTS OF INOCULATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">As we have seen, it is part of the legend that the introduction
of inoculation was fanatically resisted by
physicians, clergy, and mob; but the resistance was
neither fanatical nor extensive, and is chiefly the invention
of the romancing biographers who represent Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu as a heroine and martyr of
science. To do that shrewd and brilliant woman justice,
she made no pretence to the character imputed to her,
and in her copious correspondence, there is not a hint of
annoyance on the score of her patronage of the Turkish
modification of smallpox. On the contrary, it would
appear that inoculation brought her a large share of
that veiled notoriety in which she had sincere pleasure.
Writing to the Countess of Mar in 1723, she says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lady Byng has inoculated both her children, and since that
experiment has not had any ill effect, the whole town are doing
the same thing; and I am so much pulled about, and solicited to
visit people, that I am forced to run into the country to hide myself.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></div>

<p>Lady Mary understood her countrymen thoroughly,
and, thirty years after her exploits in inoculation, she
wrote to Mr. Wortley Montagu as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Brescia</span>, 24th April, 1748.</p>

<p>I find Tar Water succeeded to Ward’s Drop. ’Tis possible, by
this time, that some other quackery has taken place of that.
The English are easier than any other nation infatuated by the
prospect of universal medicines, nor is there any country in the
world where the doctors raise such immense fortunes. I attribute
it to the fund of credulity which is in all mankind. We have no
longer faith in miracles and relics, and therefore with the same
fury run after recipes and physicians. The same money which
three hundred years ago was given for the health of the soul is now
given for the health of the body, and by the same sort of people&mdash;women
and half-witted men.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who fancy there could be any wide or effective
resistance to inoculation in 1721 misapprehend the conditions
of the time. There was no scientific knowledge
of the laws of health; diseases were generally regarded
as mysterious dispensations of Providence over which the
sufferers had little control; and a great part of medicine
was a combination of absurdity with nastiness. It would
not be difficult to compile a series of recipes from the
pharmacopœia of that day which would alternately excite
amusement, surprise, and disgust, and to describe medical
practice from which it is marvellous that ever patient
escaped alive; but so much must pass without saying.
Suffice it to assert, that to inoculation there was little
material for opposition, rational or irrational; and that
what we might think the natural horror of transfusing
the filth of smallpox into the blood of health, was
neutralised by the currency of a multitude of popular
remedies which seemed to owe their fascination to their
outrageous and loathsome characteristics.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the dates prove, the interval was brief
between the introduction of inoculation and its authoritative
acceptance. The girl Montagu was privately
inoculated in April, 1721, Dr. Keith’s boy on the 11th of
May, the Newgate experiment took place on the 9th of
August, a variety of experiments followed, and lastly the
Princesses Amelia and Caroline were inoculated on the
19th of April, 1722&mdash;sharp work for one year. There
was not time for opposition. The citadel of social
approval was carried with a rush. As a contemporary
observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I could not but take notice with what united force and zeal the
practice was pushed on upon the life and reputation it received
from its admission to the Royal Palace; all pens and weekly
papers at work to recommend and publish it; and it was rightly
judged, then or never was the time; and had it not been for some
unlucky miscarriages, the Inoculators would have had the best
chance for full practice and full pockets that ever fell into the hands
of so small a set of men.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal approval was assiduously worked, and there
were not wanting hints that to question the goodness of
inoculation was equivalent to disloyalty; and thus we
find the Rev. E. Massey protesting in a letter to Mr.
Maitland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wish the Doctor more candour toward those who differ from
him than to insinuate that they are guilty of high treason, and a
better argument for this practice than the cry, Inoculation! and
King George for ever!<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></div>

<p>Bad reasons are often advanced against bad policy, and
whilst it is probable that some silly things were uttered
against inoculation, yet I think every candid mind would
be impressed with the moderation of Maitland’s chief
adversaries. There was Isaac Massey, for instance,
apothecary to Christ’s Hospital, who published several
pamphlets in opposition, wherein candour and good sense
are throughout conspicuous. He defined&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inoculation as an art of giving the smallpox to persons in health,
who might otherwise have lived many years, and perhaps to
a very old age without it, whereby some unhappily come to an
untimely death.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<p>He objected to the exaggerated dangers of smallpox
wherewith the Inoculators operated on the public
fears, and appealed to his own experience in Christ’s
Hospital&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Where there are generally near 600 children, the nurseries at
Ware and Hertford constantly filling the places of those who go
off. It hath sometimes happened that great numbers have been
down of the smallpox, and ’tis but seldom that the House is free,
or not long so: yet I daresay, and Sir Hans Sloane, I presume,
will say so too, that in twenty years there have not died above five
or six at most of the distemper, and in the last eight years there
died but one.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<p>So lightly did he regard the peril of smallpox to the
young that he delivered this challenge&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Suppose that twenty-five Bluecoat Hospital boys at a medium,
one year with another, taken ill of the smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose we likewise, that the Inoculators take out of the
several wards, yearly, as they find them, twenty-five boys, which
are inoculated.</p>

<p>Quere, What the difference of success? I solemnly protest that
if this could be put in practice, I would lay two to one against the
inoculated.</p>

<p>For, as I have said before, we have lost but one smallpox
patient these nine years [writing in 1723] although 1800 children
have been in the House during that time, and I declare to have
met with no unequal success in other families amongst children
about the same ages (that is between 8 and 15) where I have been
concerned, and I doubt not but many of the Learned Faculty, as
well as some others of my profession, can say as much from their
own experience and observation.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>To appreciate Massey’s contention on this point, we
have to remember that smallpox is the designation of a
disease of many degrees of intensity; a consideration
which Dr. Wagstaffe, another opponent of inoculation,
thus enforced&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is scarcely, I believe, so great a difference between any
two distempers in the world, as between the best and worse sort of
smallpox, in respect to the dangers which attend them.... So
true is that common observation, that there is one sort in which a
nurse cannot kill, and another which even a physician can never
cure.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p>Of course the Bills of Mortality were appealed to in
evidence of the extent and fatality of smallpox; and as
it is matter of common belief that prior to inoculation
and Jenner (there is always a haze about the date) people
were mown down with smallpox, it may be worth while
reviving the table of relative mortality in London during
the first twenty-two years of the 18th century.</p>

<p>By these tables [wrote Dr. Jurin] it appears that upwards of 7
per cent., or somewhat more than a fourteenth part of mankind,
die of the smallpox; and consequently the hazard of dying of that
distemper, to every individual born into the world, is at least that
of 1 in 14.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></div>

<p>This large induction from London to universal mankind
is noteworthy, because, as we shall see, it came to
be often made, and involved a serious fallacy; for unless
universal mankind dwelt in conditions similar to Londoners,
it was idle to infer a common rate of disease and
mortality. The population of London in 1701 was
estimated at about 500,000 (there was no exact census),
rising to about 600,000 in 1720. It was closely packed
and lodged over cess-pools; the water supply was
insufficient, and there was no effective drainage. The
vast multitude was disposed, as if by design, for the
generation and propagation of zymotic disease, and
specially smallpox. Little attention was paid to personal
cleanliness, and still less to ventilation, to light, to
exercise. The condition of a large urban community a
century ago is almost inconceivable at the present day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Londoners were then only slowly and blindly rising out
of those modes of existence which made the Plague of
1665, and other plagues, possible. Hence we need not
be astonished that smallpox was a common and persistent
affliction; but it was less prevalent and less deadly than
it is the custom to assert; and had the disease not been
attended with injury to feminine beauty, there might
have been no more fuss made about it than about any
other form of eruptive fever.</p>

<p>It has also to be observed, that smallpox as a cause of
death was probably much exaggerated in the Bills of
Mortality; for as Isaac Massey pointed out&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These Bills are founded on the ignorance or skill of old women,
who are the searchers in every parish, and their reports (very often
what they are bid to say) must necessarily be very erroneous.
Many distempers which prove mortal, are mistaken for the smallpox,
namely, scarlet and malignant fevers with eruptions, swinepox,
measles, St. Anthony’s fire, and such like appearances, which
if they destroy in three or four days (as frequently happeneth) the
distemper can only be guessed at, yet is generally put down by the
searchers as smallpox, especially if they are told the deceased
never had them.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></div>

<p>Massey, in the same spirit of good sense, objected to
generalisations about smallpox from the Bills of Mortality,
as if all who died were slain by the disease and
by nothing else.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There ought to be no comparison [he said] between sick people,
well regimented with diet and medicine, and those who have no
assistance, or scarcely the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The miserable poor and parish children make up a great part, at
least one-half of the Bills of Mortality; to confirm this I have
examined several yearly bills, and I find that the out-parishes
generally bury more than the ninety-seven parishes within the
walls, and the parish of Stepney singly, very near as many as the
City of London yearly; this sufficiently shows what little help and
care are taken of the poor sick, which so much abound in all those
places.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></div>

<p>Of course there lurks a fallacy in all statistics of
disease wherein conditions of life are not discriminated.
Whether patients survive or die from any zymotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ailment depends upon their breed, their circumstances,
their habits, and their medical treatment and nursing&mdash;all
essential particulars, yet difficult to define and
register on a large scale. It would appear that in sound
constitutions, and with fair treatment, smallpox in 1721
was by no means deadly, whilst in bad constitutions,
and with exposure and neglect, it was extensively fatal.
Yet of these differences, little account was taken by the
Inoculators, and the malady was measured and discussed
as though it were something uniform like water or gold.
Massey in one year had 49 cases of smallpox and one death;
in Stepney an equal number of cases might have shown
a mortality of 20 or 30 per cent.; whilst Dr. Nettleton
reported that of 1245 cases in Halifax and adjacent
towns in Yorkshire, there died 270, or about 22 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>One of Massey’s fears in relation to inoculation was
the risk of poisoning the blood with more than smallpox.
He was not disinclined to experiment with “duly prepared
children infected with smallpox by inspiration,”
for then&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They will run no hazard of being infected by a leprous, venereal,
or scrofulous taint that may, for aught we know, be transplanted
by inoculation.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></div>

<p>Massey’s prescience has been woefully verified; is
indeed under perpetual verification in the pollution and
destruction of multitudes of infants. The notion that
virus with a complex of qualities can be transferred
from one body to another, and operate with the single
quality the operator is pleased to favour, is a notion that
might pass muster in a manual of magic or folk-lore, but
which never can have any warrant in human physiology.</p>

<p>Of course the chief strength of the opponents of inoculation
(ere experience gave them stronger ground) lay
in the assertion of the folly of incurring a certain injury
for an uncertain advantage. Whatever the risk of smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to those who have it, yet large numbers, it was
argued, pass through life untouched; and why should
they make themselves sick, and risk their lives in order
to obtain a superfluous security!<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The frequent assertion that the clergy thundered
against inoculation is untrue and invented for effect.
The Rev. Edmund Massey, Lecturer of St. Alban, Wood
Street, did preach a sermon against the new practice, and
a fair sermon it was, according to the standard of sermons.
Maitland published some remarks on the sermon, to
which Massey rejoined; and if I select a passage from
the rejoinder it will prove, better than any description,
that the divine was more than a match for the surgeon.
Said Massey to Maitland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inoculation, in your sense, is an engraftment of a corrupted body
into a sound one; an attempt to give a man a disease, who is in
perfect health, which disease may prove mortal.</p>

<p>This I said was tempting Providence.</p>

<p>To which you reply, It resembles that of a person who leaps out
of a window for fear of fire; and surely that can never be reckoned
a mistrust of Providence.</p>

<p>No, certainly, Sir, if his house be really on fire, and the stairs
burnt. ’Tis the only probable way of safety left; and if the leap
should kill him, the action could neither be called sinful or imprudent.
But what should we say to a man, who jumped out of the
window when his house was not a-fire, only to try what he might
perhaps be forced to do hereafter? This mad action exactly hits
the case between us. For if my house be not on fire, that is, if I
am in no apparent danger, what need I jump out at the window?
What occasion is there to inoculate me?</p>

<p>To carry on your own allegory, I would ask you, Sir, what
human or divine authority you have to set a man’s house on fire,
that is, put a man who is in perfect health in danger of his life by
a fit of illness? His own consent is not sufficient, because he has
no more lawful power over his own life or health than you have, to
put either of them in hazard.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></div>

<p>In short, nothing can be more unfounded than the
assumption in literature, popular and professional, that
Maitland and Montagu were confronted by a crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
howling fanatics over whom they triumphed as light
over darkness. Marvellous is the imbecility wherewith
biographers and historians reproduce the fables of any
inventive predecessor.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to show that the practice of inoculation
introduced by Cotton Mather to New England,
and by Maitland to England, collapsed in a few years
under stress of the mischiefs and fatalities which attended
it; that it was revived in a subsequent generation; that
it proved a curse wherever practised; and that finally it
was abandoned with execration in the Western world.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">COLLAPSE OF INOCULATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">We sometimes fetch from afar what is to be found at our
own doors; and thus it was with inoculation. No sooner
was the great Eastern preventive advertised than it was
said&mdash;Why, it is nothing more than a practice common in
Wales and the Highlands of Scotland! Perrot Williams,
M.D., and Richard Wright, surgeon, of Haverfordwest,
communicated to the Royal Society<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that the people in
Pembrokeshire had practised inoculation “time out of
mind.” They either scraped the skin thin or pricked it
with pins, and then rubbed in pus from a smallpox
patient. This they called “buying the smallpox,” as it
was customary to pay something for what was fancied to
be “good matter.” The Welshmen gave the same account
of the practice as the Turks&mdash;there was no danger, no
mishaps, and certain security from smallpox. In Scotland
it did not appear that the skin was scraped, but
worsted threads saturated with pus were tied round the
wrists of children to whom it was desired to communicate
the disease.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Nettleton, of Halifax, Yorkshire, was an
early and energetic inoculator. He prepared his patients
by vomiting, purging, and bleeding. He disliked Maitland’s
small punctures, and made gashes an inch long&mdash;one
in the arm and one in the opposite leg, and inserted
bits of cotton steeped in pus, and covered them up with
plaster and rollers. It was his design to produce large
wounds with copious discharges, so that peccant matter
might be freely evacuated. He was well satisfied with
his heroic practice, and a record of his cases was sent to
the Royal Society<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;a record from which any reader
will be apt to conclude that there was little to choose between
Nettleton’s inoculations and smallpox itself. He
made no pretence that inoculation induced a trifling
ailment, but only one less serious than the spontaneous
disease, congratulating himself on having conveyed some
sixty inoculated patients through grave peril; whilst, he
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Halifax, since the beginning of last winter, 276 have had the
smallpox, and out of that number 43 have died. In Rochdale, a
small neighbouring market town, 177 have had the distemper, and
38 have died. It is to be noted that in this town [Halifax] the
smallpox have been more favourable this season than usual, and in
Leeds they have been more than usually mortal; but upon a
medium there have died nearly 22 out of every 100 in these three
towns, which is about a fifth part of all that have been infected in
the natural way.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></div>

<p>English experience quickly made an end of the fiction
under cover of which inoculation had been introduced&mdash;that
it was attended with no risk, and might be performed
by any old woman. Dr. Jurin, secretary of the
Royal Society, and a steady advocate of the practice, thus
laid down the conditions considered essential to success&mdash;conditions
arrived at through stress of suffering and
disaster&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Great care ought to be taken to inoculate none but persons of a
good habit of body, and free, not only from any apparent, but, as
far as can be judged, from any latent disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The body, especially if plethoric, ought to be prepared by proper
evacuations&mdash;as bleeding, purging, vomiting, etc.&mdash;though in many
cases there will be occasion for very little or none of these, it being
sufficient to enjoin a temperate diet and proper regimen. But this
must be left to the judgment of the physician.</p>

<p>The utmost caution ought to be used in the choice of proper
matter to communicate the infection. It should be taken from a
young subject, otherwise perfectly sound and healthful, who has
the smallpox in the most favourable manner. When the pustules
are properly maturated, and just upon the turn, or soon after, two
or three of them should be ripped with a glover’s needle or small
lancet, and a couple of small pledgets of lint or cotton are to be
well moistened with the matter, and immediately put into a little
vial or box, and carried in the warm hand or bosom of the operator
to the house of the person to be inoculated.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>The publication of these conditions was little short of
a practical surrender, and the opponents of inoculation
were not slow to avail themselves of the advantage.
What had been proclaimed the easy and universal defence
against smallpox proved hedged about with precautions
and preparations for which only health with wealth was
equal. Where was the profit, argued Francis Howgrave,
of a practice which leaves the feeble and delicate and
poor to their fate, which makes the well sick, and wounds
those that are whole, whilst smallpox in the natural way
very rarely affects life where the habit of body and constitution
are good.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Isaac Massey was especially indignant
over Jurin’s comparison of the mortality of smallpox
with the mortality of inoculation. Jurin reckoned that
out of every 100 who took smallpox, 20 died, whilst
only 2 in 100 died from the effects of inoculation. “He
forgets,” said Massey, “that the inoculated are picked
lives. If this be fair, Hang fair!” Massey was right.
It was absurd to institute a comparison between the
common smallpox, comprising that of the poor and
neglected, and the well-fed and carefully tended subjects
of inoculation. Massey, too, was strong in his own
experience, saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have a list of the names of 32 children, who are all that have
had the smallpox during the last two years [1727] in Christ’s
Hospital, and every one recovered. I have had, besides, 17 or 18
more in my private business, of whom only one died. Here, then,
we have 49 cases of natural smallpox and but 1 death.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>

<p>Emphatic likewise was his protest against the exaggeration
of the inoculators.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A natural simple smallpox seldom kills, unless under very ill
management, or when some lurking evil that was quiet before is
roused in the fluids and confederated with the pocky ferment.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></div>

<p>At this point we may see the judgment and the fears of
the English people had gone against inoculation, and the
practice appeared destined to gradual extinction. According
to the inoculators, their work was thus summarised&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus stood the account by the inoculators’ own showing,
and it was by no means a satisfactory balance-sheet.
What strikes one painfully in looking over it, is the vast
preponderance of the young and defenceless (780 out of
897) upon whom the abominable experiment was tried.
“Helplessness which commands the protection of the
brave is the opportunity of the investigating sneak.”
Whilst the inoculators argued laboriously that if some
danger attended artificial smallpox, it was trifling to that
attached to the spontaneous disease (among other obvious
replies), it was maintained that only after much wider
experience could it be known what were the precise
effects of inoculation. Inoculation, as introduced by
Maitland in 1721, had proved vastly different after
acquaintance, and there was no telling what remained to
be revealed. As Dr. Wagstaffe observed&mdash;</p>

<p>Had it always been slight, gentle, safe, and useful, with all those
alluring epithets bestowed on it; had none had above a hundred
or two hundred pustules, and no one died of it in the space of
several years; and had there been no instance of any one’s being
ever again infected with smallpox who had any pustules at all, how
few soever, raised by inoculation, nobody would sooner have subscribed
to the practice than myself.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></div>

<p>The primal promise that the inoculated were thereafter
proof against smallpox was speedily belied, but that
difficulty was disposed of by the assertion that inoculation
in such cases must have been imperfect, for it was
impossible for any one to have smallpox twice. The
admission of fatalities from inoculation was very tardily
made; and they were generally referred to some cause
perversely concealed from the inoculator, which, had he
known, would have prevented his operation. Then, the
manifest fatalities were naturally suspected to stand for
a larger number sedulously kept out of sight. As Massey
put it&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ill success of inoculation is very partially and sparingly given
to the world. The operator will not tell it, who lives by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
practice; nor will the relations, to whose authority the mischief is
owing, be fond of revealing that to the public, which is grief to
them in private.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></div>

<p>Fortunately for the public, several of the mishaps
occurred in “good society,” and were too conspicuous to
be hushed up or denied. Miss Rigby died eight weeks
after inoculation, “miserably disordered by the operation.”
A son of the Duke of Bridgewater and a son of the Earl
of Sunderland likewise perished; and a servant of Lord
Bathurst died of confluent smallpox “consequent on
engraftment.” Such incidents struck terror everywhere,
and caused wise and timid alike to face the ills they knew
rather than risk certain peril for uncertain advantage.</p>

<p>Maitland returned to Scotland, his native country, in
1726, and, going among his relations in Aberdeenshire,
showed off his skill by inoculating six children. One of
them, Adam, son of William Urquhart of Meldrum, aged
18 months, sickened on the seventh, and died on the
eighth day. There was a great outcry, and Maitland
tried to excuse himself by asserting that Adam was
afflicted with hydrocephalus, which had been improperly
concealed from him. Anyhow, the Aberdeenshire folk
were satisfied with their experience, and recommended
“Charlie Maitland to keep his new-fangled remedy for
the English in future.” He was more fortunate in the
west of Scotland, where he “inoculated four children of
a noble family,” who escaped alive. The Scots, however,
were deaf to his persuasions, and he made no headway
among them. At a later date, 1733, inoculation began
to be practised in and about Dumfries, and occasionally
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Ireland little more was effected than in Scotland.
It was said that 25 inoculations took place between 1723
and 1728 with 3 fatalities. Dr. Bryan Robinson inoculated
five children in Dublin in 1725, and was the death of two
of them.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Inoculation met with faint acceptance on the Continent.
Maitland went over to Hanover in 1724 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
inoculated Prince Frederick and eight children of Baron
de Schulenberg. In France the practice had been discussed
by Dr. Boyer so far back as 1717; and in 1723 the English
experiments were recounted in Paris with much enthusiasm
by Dr. de la Coste, evoking a declaration from
the College of Physicians, “that for the benefit of the
public, it was lawful to make trials of inoculation.” A
commencement was about to be made in the hospitals
under the Sanction of the Regent, the Duke of Orleans,
when his death put a stop to the design. Soon after Dr.
Hecquet published <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raisons de Doute contre l’Inoculation</cite>,
which, coupled with bad reports from England, made an
end of the project.</p>

<p>If a London journalist had been called upon in 1728
to report upon Inoculation, he might have written as
follows&mdash;</p>

<p>Seven years ago the practice was introduced to this
country under powerful auspices. It was confidently
averred that anyone might have his blood infected with
the virus of smallpox, that a trifling ailment would ensue,
and that thenceforward he would be secure from smallpox
in the natural form. Experience rapidly belied
these promises. The trifling ailment proved, in many
cases, a serious ailment&mdash;so serious that physicians tried
to anticipate and mitigate its severity by a preliminary
regimen of bleeding, purging and vomiting. So exhausting
and hazardous is the whole operation, that only sound
and vigorous constitutions are considered fit for it; and
the delicate and feeble, who require protection most, are
advised to submit themselves as of old to the ordinary
course of nature. Moreover, the induced smallpox is
occasionally as severe as the spontaneous; the pustules
are multitudinous, and sometimes confluent, with death
for the issue. Fear may exaggerate the risks of inoculation,
but more are believed to have perished than the
inoculators are willing to confess. Again, many are not
susceptible of inoculation, and though the infection fails
to operate in their blood as desired, they do not always
escape injury: they find their health disordered&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
rendered sickly and uncomfortable. Worst of all, what
none at first reckoned on, the artificial smallpox turns out
to be infectious, and begets natural smallpox in those who
are with the inoculated. Thus, the very means taken to
limit the disease become a cause of its extension. Smallpox
was more than usually prevalent in Hertford in
1721, and in London in 1724, and there was fair reason
to conjecture that it was extensively disseminated by
inoculation. Lastly, it is doubtful whether even successful
inoculation protects from subsequent smallpox; for it
is maintained that some of the inoculated have already
fallen victims to the natural disorder. In short, the
preventive appears to have so many drawbacks that it is
questionable whether it is not worse than the malady;
and it is probable that in a year or two it will pass into
forgetfulness in common with many other remedies as
highly extolled on early and imperfect acquaintance.</p>

<p>So much might have been stated and prognosticated in
1728: how the prognostic failed to be verified remains to
be told.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">REVIVAL OF INOCULATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The practice of inoculation, thus discredited, revived,
and not only revived, but prevailed. The revival was
gradual, and may be said to have acquired definition
about 1748, under the powerful approval of Dr. Mead.
In the score of years from 1728 to 1748, it is not to be
imagined that the practice was abandoned: there were
always a few repeating the attempt to have smallpox
without the penalties of smallpox, but success was not
conspicuous or encouraging. Inoculation was introduced
to a generation specially disposed to receive it; and it
was only allowed to slip for a time under the compulsion
of manifest disaster. Perhaps there never was a people
with such a taste for dodges in favour of health as the
English of last century: the common intelligence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
invested in quackery. Even Wesley found time to
dabble in medicine, and to compile a volume of prescriptions
for his followers, entitled <cite>Primitive Physic</cite>&mdash;a
piquant mixture of sense with absurdity and credulity.
Our forefathers had no clear conception of the connection
of physical well-being with physical well-doing, and many
of the essential conditions of health were unknown to
them. Their physical afflictions were regarded as mysterious
dispensations to be endured with resignation or
frustrated with medicines. The same attitude of mind
is far from uncommon at the present day, and many will
recollect how, ere sanitary science attained repute, it was
considered profane to assert that typhus was subject to
control, and that cholera might be suppressed; whilst a
drug to subdue either would be heard of with gratitude.
Superstition has rarely had any objection to the
apothecary.</p>

<p>An incident passed over in histories, although far more
inwardly characteristic of the mind of the 18th century
than a multitude of the superficialities wherewith their
pages are cumbered, is that of Joanna Stephens and her
remedies for the stone. Her cures were so remarkable
and (on evidence) so indisputable, that a general demand
arose for the revelation of her secret for the public
benefit. This revelation Mrs. Stephens agreed to make
on receipt of £5000 as compensation; and a subscription
was started, to which Fellows of the Royal Society,
physicians, noblemen, bishops, ladies, and kindly folk of
all orders set their names. Such, however, was the
unanimity and anxiety to possess the Stephens secret,
that it was pronounced a national concern, and Parliament
was invoked to supply the requisite funds; whereon
an Act was passed “for providing a reward to Joanna
Stephens upon a proper discovery to be made by her of
the medicines prepared by her for the cure of the stone.”
The discovery was duly disclosed to appointed trustees,
one of whom was Archbishop of Canterbury, and the
£5000 was paid over in 1739; and here we have the
heads of the precious revelation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My medicines are a Powder, a Decoction, and a Pill.</p>

<p>The Powder consists of egg-shells and snails, both calcined.</p>

<p>The Decoction is made by boiling camomile, fennel, parsley,
and burdock leaves (together with a ball, which consists of soap,
swine’s cresses burnt to a blackness, and honey) in water.</p>

<p>The Pills consist of snails calcined, wild carrot seeds, burdock
seeds, ashen keys, hips and hawes, all burnt to a blackness, soap
and honey.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Joanna Stephens.</span></p>

<p>16th June, 1739.</p></div>

<p>The public were apparently satisfied with the purchase,
but with the usual levity of credulity forgot Mrs.
Stephens and her marvellous cures in the pursuit of
fresh nostrums. Fashions in medicine are on a par with
fashions in dress, and have only occasional reference to
the permanence and veracity of nature.</p>

<p>The revival of inoculation in England was stimulated
by reports from abroad. For instance, in the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> it was stated that in 1737 there were
inoculated in Philadelphia&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Men and Women,</td><td class="tdl">32</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Children under twelve,</td><td class="tdl">64</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Negroes,</td><td class="tdl">32</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noindent">and that out of the 128 only one Negro died. Again,
in the same magazine for 1738 we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Barbados in March last there were upwards of 3000 persons
down in the smallpox, where inoculation is practised with great
success.</p></div>

<p>Such reports, whilst secure from examination, were
none the less effective over the public imagination.
There was a report published by Dr. Mead in 1747,
which derived great credit from his endorsement, and
which continues to be cited to the present day as proof
for inoculation, but which is a model of convenient and
circumstantial vagueness worthy of Defoe. Thus Mead’s
story runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following relation was communicated to me by a gentleman
of great credit. He was a merchant at St. Christopher’s in the
West Indies, and in the making of sugar employed a great number
of slaves. In one year, when the smallpox raged with more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ordinary violence in the neighbouring islands, with his own hands
he inoculated three hundred of them, from five to sixty years of
age, with such success, that not one of them died, though most of
them were negroes. And whereas all the Americans suffer this
distemper in a most terrible manner, yet experience shows, that it
is much more dangerous when it attacks the natives of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></div>

<p>Mead held positions which later and more exact inquiry
rendered untenable. He would not allow that the
pus of smallpox could communicate any disease but
smallpox, <em>if</em> taken from a proper subject&mdash;a condition
that required supernatural assistance to fulfil. He maintained
that inoculation generated true smallpox, and that
as no one could have smallpox twice, therefore no one
could have smallpox after inoculation, and that reports
to the contrary were not credible. It now goes without
saying that in this contention Mead was at fault, but at
the time his confidence was not inexcusable; and whilst
defending and recommending inoculation, he made admissions
which fully justified those who resisted and
condemned his counsels. Let us not forget that the
following passage was published in 1747, and was the
fruit of six-and-twenty years of experience in the best
London practice. Thus Mead wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It ought not to be omitted, that boils and swellings under the
ears and in the arm-pits arise more frequently after the distemper
procured by art than after that which comes of its own accord; for
this reason, as I suppose, that the venomous matter is pushed forward
with less force, which disadvantages Nature makes amends
for in this way.</p>

<p>Therefore all possible means are to be used to ripen such tumours
of whatever kind they are: if this cannot be done, they must be
opened by incision; and when all the matter is drawn out, the
body must be purged by proper medicines, which are to be oftener
repeated in this than in the natural disease.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>How just are the judgments of Divine Order! These
boils, swellings, and tumours, were the sequences of the
violated harmony of the body&mdash;of the faithless anticipation,
the meddling and muddling with its processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>An extensive series of inoculations took place in
1742-45 in the south of England. Smallpox was prevalent
in Winchester and adjacent towns, and Dr. Langrish
operated freely on whoever resorted to him. In Portsmouth,
Chichester, Guildford, Petersfield, and Winchester,
it was said that at least 2,000 were poxed, and that only
two pregnant women perished, who, as usual, “were inoculated
contrary to the advice of their physician.” The ill
results, wrote Bishop Maddox, “were only such as might
reasonably be supposed to have been worse had those
operated on had smallpox in the natural way”&mdash;such
being the euphemism wherewith boils, tumours, and
other sequelæ were accounted for.</p>

<p>The reviving favour for inoculation was indicated in
this paragraph from the newspapers of 13th April, in
1744&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fourteen children, three years old, having been inoculated for
the smallpox in the Foundling Hospital, Hatton Garden, all with
good success, the Governors have resolved to have all their children
inoculated at the same age.</p></div>

<p>An important movement was made in 1746 with the
opening of a Smallpox Hospital in Cold Bath Fields at
which “the benefit of inoculation” was offered to the
poor. At first those who applied were taken into the
house, and nursed through their self-inflicted illness, but
the proximity of the veritable smallpox, the regimen,
and the seclusion were sufficient to deter applicants:
those, however, who have a hobby to ride grow reckless
in presence of obstacles, and by-and-by inoculation was
offered to all comers, who were dismissed to recover and
diffuse infection in their own homes.</p>

<p>With the revival of inoculation there was a revival of
the controversy as to its lawfulness theologically. Dr.
Isaac Maddox, Bishop of Worcester, preached a sermon
on behalf of the Smallpox Hospital in St. Andrew’s,
Holborn, on 5th March, 1752,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which excited considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
attention. He showed the necessity for such an
hospital for the poor and forsaken of the great city&mdash;a
necessity incontestable. He mentioned (and the remark
supplies a curious note on the hygiene of the time) that
ventilators were to be introduced, and it was expected
that the access of fresh air might benefit the
patients. The return of the Hospital for 1752 showed
344 admissions, with 262 recoveries, and 82 deaths&mdash;a
proportion that does not contrast disadvantageously with
19th century hospitals, fortified with sanitary appliances.
During the same year 112 inoculations were effected at
the Hospital. The Bishop had been assured by three
eminent surgeons that they had inoculated 1500 persons
with only 3 fatalities, one of them (Sergeant Ranby)
having accomplished one thousand without a mishap.
The practice was without doubt lawful, for it averted a
dangerous disease, and some risk was inseparable from
all methods of cure. The practice had already done
much to lessen smallpox, and, as it became commoner, it
would do more. The result of the sermon was a subscription
of £809 for the charity at the subsequent
dinner in the Drapers’ Hall.</p>

<p>The Bishop was singularly at fault in his ascription of
diminished mortality to inoculation, for, in 1752, smallpox
was more than unusually rife in the Metropolis, and its
prevalence was not unreasonably attributed to infection
from the inoculated. In 1751 the deaths from smallpox
in London were 998; they rose to 3538 in 1752; declined
to 774 in 1753; and rose to 2359 in 1754.</p>

<p>Dr. Doddridge lent his powerful influence in favour
of inoculation; and, considering the unqualified assertions
of medical men as to its benefits and harmlessness,
it cannot be said he was blameworthy. The audacious
assurance with which many of them bore down opposition
overcame the simple-minded, who argued as if the
world were constituted after the pattern of their own
innocent hearts. That smallpox frequently followed
inoculation is now known beyond dispute, and yet Dr.
Kirkpatrick wrote&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have heard myself a great many rumours of the inoculated
being naturally infected afterwards, which upon examination
proved just as many lies.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></div>

<p>How could women and divines resist such evidence?</p>

<p>A voluble antagonist of inoculation was the Rev.
Theodore Delafaye of Canterbury. He preached a sermon
in that city on the 3rd of June, 1753, from the
text, “Let us do evil that good may come” (Rom. iii. 8),
and published it under the title of <cite>Inoculation an Indefensible
Practice</cite>. He was in turn attacked by the
inoculators, and in 1754 issued <cite>A Vindication</cite> of 200
pages, in which he returned more than he received with
vigour rather than discretion. His conclusion was&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inoculation I maintain to be, in a religious and moral view, a
self-destructive, inhuman, and impious machination, and in a physical
one an unreasonable, unnatural, unlawful, most hazardous,
ineffectual, fruitless, uncertain, unnecessary device; in a word, a
practice which nature recoils at, which reason opposes, and which
religion condemns.</p></div>

<p>We sometimes read that inoculation was denounced
as Atheism, and we are expected to reprobate or to
smile at the bigotry; and, whilst we may not approve
of the stigma, we may at the same time recognise the
honest sense in which it might be affixed. Some who
spoke of inoculation as Atheistic felt more vividly
than they could otherwise describe, that it was an infraction
of the deeper sanctity of Nature, where man’s
hand cannot enter and prosper, and that those who made
the attempt could have no proper sense of Him in whom
they lived, and moved, and had their being. Moreover,
if we are to admit that they who thus expressed themselves
are blameable for excessive vehemence, what are
we to say of the more numerous party who did not hesitate
to pronounce inoculation a discovery effected in the
human mind by God himself? If it was reasonable to
speak of the practice as Theistic, why should it be
fanatical to assert the contrary, and maintain that it
involved a negation of Divine Providence? Dr. Kirkpatrick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with the sycophancy which was the custom of
his age, praised George II. for “the benevolent, and even
celestial disposition,” which induced him to patronise
“the wonderful and probably Heaven-descended practice
of inoculation;” and extolled “its equal simplicity and
success” as demonstrating “to a reflective mind the
goodness of Providence in making what may be so often
necessary, so easily accomplished.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It would not be
difficult to cite scores of confessions of gratitude to God
for inoculation, but to what purpose?</p>

<p>What we think good we necessarily ascribe to God;
and we do well; but much that we think good is otherwise,
or is only partially good; and what then? Why,
we are undeceived and corrected by experience. We put
our notion of what is good to the test of practice, and
God answers us in the event&mdash;justifies, amends, or confounds
us. Thus with inoculation. It was fair that
those who thought it good should refer it to God, and
thank him for it; and it was equally fair that those who
thought it bad should say it was none of his&mdash;that it was
at variance with his order, and a discredit to the intelligence
of those who imputed it to Him. How was the
issue to be determined? Only by God himself. And how
would He speak? In the results of experience wherein
his will would become manifest beyond equivocation.</p>

<p>In 1754 inoculation obtained full recognition from the
London College of Physicians. It was declared “that
experience had refuted the arguments urged against the
practice; that it was now more extensively employed in
England than ever; and that it was highly beneficial to
mankind.” The fence of hesitation was thrown down,
and to be inoculated became the distinction of all who
wished to be numbered with the enlightened and prudent.
That the Circassians were famous for their beauty, and
that they practised inoculation, was a staple argument,
and an irresistible, with a multitude of Englishwomen.
Opposition was chiefly confined to the lower orders, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
objected to have the inoculated at large among them,
and in some places threatened to demolish the houses
where inoculation was performed.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Occasionally a medical
practitioner acquired reputation as an inoculator,
and was resorted to by patients from a distance, and
his operations were not regarded with much favour by
his neighbours. Thus the physicians and surgeons of
Newbury, Berks, were compelled by their townsmen to
promise to inoculate no one who had not resided in Newbury
at least two years.</p>

<p>The new practice created much business, and its distribution
excited some jealousy. Physicians complained
that surgeons inoculated without their assistance, and surgeons
that apothecaries did so likewise. Dr. Kirkpatrick
laid down the rule that every rightly conducted inoculation
involved the employment of physician, surgeon,
and apothecary&mdash;the physician to prepare and prescribe
for the patient, the surgeon to cut, infuse, and dress,
and the apothecary to make up the medicines. Some,
however, dispensed with all three, and effected their
own inoculations. A boy poxed fourteen of his school-fellows
in sport, and amateur inoculators, male and female,
multiplied. As an example of amateur procedure, Dr.
Kirkpatrick relates that a gentleman of Kent sent his servant,
Silvanus, a young man, to Mrs. Chapman, at Heathfield,
to be inoculated. He had to ride thirteen miles, and
arrived hot and fatigued at the house of the inoculatrix.
As he had taken his preparatory physic at his master’s,
Mrs. Chapman desired him to get ready at once for the
operation, which he begged her to defer as he was in such
a heat. She replied that he must be inoculated that very
day, Tuesday, or remain until the following week, for
Tuesday was her lucky day. The poor fellow allowed
himself to be persuaded, and was then and there inoculated:
severe smallpox ensued, and he died.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Thus was inoculation revived and established, and
smallpox with it&mdash;established and diffused.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">TRIUMPH OF INOCULATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">It having come to pass, according to the boast of Dr.
Kirkpatrick, that inoculation was regarded as “the most
salutary practice ever discovered for restraining a very
loathsome and destroying disorder, which it had nearly
expunged from the catalogue of mortal diseases,” it was
the aim of physicians and patients to reduce the trouble
and hazard of the operation to the lowest terms possible.
In the words of Dr. Jenner, “There was bleeding till the
blood was thin, purging till the body was wasted to a
skeleton, and starving on vegetable diet to keep it so;”
and practitioners who promised to mitigate these rigours,
placed themselves in the line of popularity and prosperity.</p>

<p>Among distinguished easy inoculators was a family
named Sutton&mdash;“the Suttons” being a familiar name a
century ago. Dr. Robert Sutton practised surgery and
pharmacy at Debenham, in Suffolk, and went into inoculation
with such energy that between 1757 and 1767
he operated on 2514 patients. His son, Robert, set up as
inoculator at Bury St. Edmunds, where he did a large
business; but a second son, Daniel, was the genius of the
household. He had been acting as assistant to Mr. Bumstead
at Oxford, and returned to his father in 1763
enthusiastic over a new plan of inoculation whereby the
time of preparation was to be shortened, whilst the
patients were to live in the open air. Old Sutton
showed no favour for the projected innovation, whereon
Daniel opened an inoculating house on his own account
at Ingatestone, in Essex, advertising himself as inoculator
on a new, safe, and sure method. The speculation
answered. In 1764 he took 2000 guineas, and in 1765
his receipts were £6300. His fame spread throughout
the country, and so many resorted to him that lodgings
were scarcely to be had in and around Ingatestone. His
practice in Kent was also extensive, and he was obliged
to employ assistants. To crown his enterprise, he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a parson&mdash;the Rev. Robert Houlton, to puff his skill and
success. According to Houlton, the business of Daniel
Sutton during three years was as follows&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">to which number was added 6000 inoculated by Sutton’s
assistants, making a total of 20,000, without, said Houlton,
a single death.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Sutton was denounced as a quack, and if to reserve
as one’s own, and to traffic in what is proclaimed to be
for the common advantage of mankind, constitutes a
quack, Sutton was one. Nevertheless, he was successful,
and his success begot so much jealousy that he was
indicted at the Chelmsford quarter sessions, but acquitted
with the thanks of the grand jury for the lesson he had
taught the Faculty.</p>

<p>Much ingenuity was exercised in ferreting out Sutton’s
secret. His secret, so far as it was anything, was an
open one; and supposing it necessary to infect men’s
blood with variolous pus, and then to operate for their
recovery, there would be much to say for Sutton’s procedure.
His patients were obliged to go through a strict
preparatory regimen for a fortnight, during which every
kind of animal food, with the exception of milk, and all
fermented liquors and spices were forbidden. Fruit of
all sorts was allowed, unless on days when purges were
taken. In the course of a fortnight a powder was thrice
administered at bed-time, and a dose of salts on the
succeeding morning. When the days of preparation
were accomplished, the patient was taken to the inoculating
house, where in the public room was found an array
of people in various stages of smallpox. From one of
these sufferers, the operator selected a pustule to his
mind, opened it with his lancet, and, turning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
patient to be poxed, raised the cuticle on the outer part
of his arm with the moist lancet, and pressed it down
with his finger. This was the entire operation: no
plaster or bandage was applied: and from that moment
the patient was pronounced proof against smallpox, even
if he should lie in bed with one suffering from the
disease. Of course there remained the variolous affection
to be dealt with. The regimen of preparation was continued
unchanged, and a pill was taken nightly until the
fever came on. None were allowed to rest in bed, except
for sleep, but had to walk abroad and enjoy fresh air,
even in winter weather. If a patient was too sick to go
alone, he was supported by attendants; and when the
fever was at its height, he was encouraged to drink
copiously of cold water.</p>

<p>Much more was attributed to Sutton’s pills and powders
than to his regimen, and these were no more than
preparations of antimony and mercury, with which
practitioners of all orders were only too familiar. Sutton,
however, contrived to maintain his mystery until he had
no longer occasion for it, and lived to recognise a successor
in Jenner. He removed to London in 1767 in hope of
enlarging his income, but like many other provincial
celebrities, discovered that he had better have remained
where he shone without rivals and detractors.</p>

<p>The Sutton regimen, so far as it might be described as
“cool,” came into general favour, whilst what was called
the hot regimen of warm rooms, bed, and cordials was
correspondingly discredited. Contrasting the two methods,
Sir George Baker, writing in 1771, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I found that in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex,
many thousands of people of all ages and constitutions, and some
of them with every apparent disadvantage, had been inoculated
with general good success; whereas at Blandford, in Dorset, out
of 384 who were inoculated, 13 actually died, and many others
narrowly escaped with their lives from confluent smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></div>

<p>A famous inoculator was Dr. Thomas Dimsdale of
Hertford, a Quaker of easy principles. He published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
1766 a treatise entitled <cite>The Present Method of Inoculating
for the Smallpox</cite>&mdash;an exposition of the most approved
practice of the time, which, by one of those curious
felicities of circumstance, conferred on him a European
reputation; and in 1781, <cite>Tracts on Inoculation</cite>&mdash;a record
of his opinions and adventures at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Dimsdale desired to universalise inoculation, but with
circumspection. He recommended that the inhabitants
of a suitable district should be dealt with as a whole and
at once. That the names of all should be taken, and on
a certain day that everyone, who had not had smallpox,
should be inoculated. That the district should then
continue in quarantine for about three weeks, at the end
of which the danger and the fear of smallpox would
cease, until an unpolluted generation should afresh
accumulate. The project was not mere dreaming. Dimsdale
was a man of influence and energy, and effected
several complete inoculations of villages and parishes in
Hertfordshire according to his plan. In later years, he
combined banking with medicine, and the firm of Dimsdale,
Fowler, and Co. of Cornhill originated with him and
perpetuates his name.</p>

<p>Dimsdale’s practice lay chiefly among the upper classes,
to whom he made matters very comfortable. As he
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not enjoin any restriction in respect to diet, nor direct any
medicines to be taken before the time of operation by such as
appear to be in a proper state of health.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

<p>He was satisfied with administering a powder on the
evening of the day on which a patient was inoculated,
consisting of calomel, tartar emetic, and crabs’ claws.</p>

<p>Whilst labouring to popularise inoculation, Dimsdale
was strongly opposed to the trade therein passing to unauthorised
hands&mdash;simple, safe, and salutary though he
asserted it to be. Thus he averred&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mischiefs arising from the practice of inoculation by the
illiterate and ignorant are beyond conception.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>How illiteracy should affect inoculation, he left to
conjecture. He apparently forgot that the practice was
derived from people who made no pretence to literature,
and whose efficiency and success were, moreover, set
forth as warrant and encouragement for English imitation.</p>

<p>In 1775 a Society was formed for General Inoculation,
and an hospital was opened for the purpose at Battle
Bridge, on the site of what is now the Great Northern
Railway station, King’s Cross. Dr. Lettsom, a popular
Quaker physician, issued an appeal on behalf of the
enterprise, and having invoked Dr. Dimsdale’s approval, a
lively controversy ensued between the brethren&mdash;personal
rather than profitable. Dimsdale disapproved of indiscriminate
inoculation: he was ready to inoculate the
whole world, but systematically, and under strict safe-guards.
He pointed out that whatever might be the
advantage to the individual, unless the inoculated patient
was rigorously secluded, he would diffuse the disease
from which he sought to be delivered, and that the price
of his life might be the destruction of many. Dimsdale’s
warnings were, however, slightly regarded, and inoculation
was pursued with criminal recklessness. As Pascal
observes, of all the faculties given to man, the most
awful in its consequences is the power of standing amid
a number of facts, and seeing such as we please to see,
and being blind to the rest.</p>

<p>Specially remarkable in connection with the smallpox
of last century was the exaggerated terror expressed for
it by professional inoculators, and the little real terror
manifested by the multitude. It was by no means the
most fatal of diseases, nor was it a large factor in the
common mortality. Wherever we test the matter by
unbiased contemporary evidence, we find the outcry
factitious: the dreadful and desolating malady from
which Jenner delivered his country is merely a fiction
continued by the vaccinators from the inoculators. For
proof let us turn to the evidence of Dr. Alexander Monro,
Professor of Medicine and Anatomy in the University of
Edinburgh. The Faculty of Medicine in Paris had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
appointed a commission to inquire into the advantages of
inoculation, which in the course of duty applied to Monro,
who in response produced and published in 1765 <cite>An
Account of the Inoculation of Smallpox in Scotland</cite>.
He reported that from the introduction of the practice
by Maitland in 1726, there had been 5554 inoculations
effected in Scotland with 72 fatalities; that is to say
about 140 annually with deaths 1 in 78, according to the
confession of the inoculators themselves. Monro further
stated that the practice was disliked in Scotland as “a
tempting of Providence,” an unwarrantable risk of life
for an uncertain advantage. Our present interest, however,
is in the statistics of deaths from smallpox in
Edinburgh for a series of twenty years thus adduced by
Monro.</p>

<p>Here we have a piece of valid experience with every
advantage to the smallpox terrorist: for Edinburgh last
century was a city contrived as if for the generation and
perpetuation of smallpox. The population of 55,000 was
lodged thickly in flats, in houses of many storeys, closely
built in lanes and courts&mdash;a population densely compacted
as any in Europe, with arrangements for cleanliness
indescribable, at this day perhaps incredible. Yet
in conditions so propitious to smallpox, we see before us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the total outcome during a series of twenty years; and
reprehensible as the result may appear to contemporary
sanitarians, who hold, and rightly hold, that all zymotic
diseases are preventible, yet it affected Monro with no
anxiety or dismay: nor does the rate of mortality of old
Edinburgh contrast unfavourably with that of the modern
city. The case of Edinburgh, however, serves to show
that in all cases when we hear of the ravages of smallpox
before Jenner appeared as deliverer, our policy is to insist
firmly upon the production of special and adequate
evidence: it is monstrous that the assertions of common
quacks, whether inoculators or vaccinators, should pass
into tradition and be accepted as unquestionable verity.</p>

<p>We have, moreover, to observe that the mortality from
smallpox in Edinburgh was infantile mortality: for as
Monro testified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inhabitants of Scotland generally have the smallpox in their
infancy or childhood; very few adults being seen in this disease.
Whether this is owing to any particular constitution of the air, or
of the people, or to the disease not being so much dreaded as to
cause any to fly from the place where it is, or to the great intercourse
which must be among the inhabitants of the towns, of which
several, nay, many families enter to their houses by one common
stair, while in the villages the peasants are generally assistant to
their neighbours of whose family any is sick, it is not now necessary
to inquire.</p></div>

<p>Not only were the habits of the people contributory to
the diffusion of eruptive disorders, but likewise their
food, of which oatmeal was the staple, whilst vegetables
were few, fruit rare, and tea unknown. Hence many
maladies had free course; and as Dean Ramsay relates, a
girl on her arrival at Mrs. Betty Muirheid’s boarding-school
in the Trongate, Glasgow, when asked whether
she had had smallpox, replied, “Yes, mem, I’ve had the
sma’pox, the nirls [measles], the blabs [nettle-rash], the
scaw [itch], the kink-host [whooping-cough], the fever,
the branks [mumps], and the worm [toothache].”</p>

<p>Whilst we do not resort to epitaphs for truth, we may
discover in them what was taken for truth, or what was
wished to be taken for truth. We have in the foregoing
epitaph the legend which has caught the popular fancy,
and which is likely to survive corrections innumerable.
It is the custom of mankind to identify a common movement
with some prominent or picturesque figure in the
movement, and to suppress the rest. The practice is
convenient, but it taints all history with fable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be said that the practice of inoculation met
with no active resistance in England during the last
thirty years of last century. How widely and deeply it
extended it would be difficult to determine. The probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
is, that the mass of the population was untouched,
and that inoculation was limited to the upper and middle
classes, and to the lower so far as they came under the
immediate influence of those above them. We have,
perhaps, an index to the condition of affairs in Dr. Wm.
Buchan’s <cite>Domestic Medicine</cite>, first published in 1769,
which ran through eighteen editions, amounting to
80,000 copies, in the author’s life-time. It is not uncommon
to refer contemptuously to Buchan, but his work
was the production of a man of vigorous good sense with
faith in the good sense of his readers&mdash;a book creditable
to the author and to the people who appreciated him.</p>

<p>Buchan was an inoculator, a zealous advocate of inoculation,
and earnestly laboured to universalise the practice.
In the <cite>Domestic Medicine</cite>, ed. 1797, he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No discovery can be of general utility while the practice of it is
kept in the hands of a few. Had Inoculation been practised by the
same kind of operators in our country as in the countries from
which we derived it, it had long ago been universal. The fears,
the jealousies, the prejudices, and the opposite interests of the
Faculty are, and ever will be, the most effectual obstacles to the
progress of any salutary discovery. Hence it is that Inoculation
never became in any manner general in England till taken up by
men not bred to physic.</p></div>

<p>Consistently with this opinion, Buchan strongly advocated
domestic practice, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They know very little of the matter, who impute the success of
modern inoculators to any superior skill, either in preparing the
patient or communicating the disease. Some of them, indeed,
from a sordid desire of engrossing the whole practice to themselves,
pretend to have extraordinary secrets or nostrums for preparing
persons for inoculation, which never fail of success. But this is
only a pretence calculated to blind the ignorant and inattentive.
Common-sense and prudence alone are sufficient both in the choice
of the subject and management of the operation. Whoever is
possessed of these may perform this office for his children whenever
he finds it convenient, <em>provided they be in a good state of health</em>.</p>

<p>This statement is not the result of theory, but of observation.
Though few physicians have had more opportunities of trying
inoculation in all its different forms, so little appears to me to
depend on those generally reckoned important circumstances, of
preparing the body, communicating the infection by this or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
other method, etc., that, for several years past, I have persuaded
parents and nurses to perform the entire operation themselves.</p>

<p>I have known many instances of mothers inoculating their children,
and never so much as heard of one bad consequence.
Common mechanics often, to my knowledge, perform the operation
with as good success as physicians.</p></div>

<p>Having described the ordinary method of inoculation by
incision with a lancet dipped in pus, he goes on to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If fresh matter be applied long enough to the skin, there is no
occasion for any wound at all. Let a bit of thread, about half an
inch long, wet with the matter, be immediately applied to the arm,
midway between the shoulder and the elbow, and covered with a
piece of common sticking-plaster, and kept on for eight or ten days.
This will seldom fail to communicate the disease.</p>

<p>Instead of multiplying arguments to recommend this practice, I
shall beg leave to mention the case of my own son, at the time an
only child. After giving him two gentle purges, I ordered the nurse
to take a bit of thread which had been previously wet with fresh
matter from a pock, and to lay it upon his arm, covering it with a
piece of sticking-plaster. This remained on six or seven days, until
it was rubbed off by accident. At the usual time smallpox made
their appearance, and were exceedingly favourable. Surely this,
which is all that is generally necessary, may be done without any
skill in medicine.</p></div>

<p>Thus was smallpox made easy!</p>

<p>Buchan appealed to the clergy for co-operation as inoculators&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The persons to whom we would chiefly recommend the performance
of this operation are the clergy. Most of them know something
of medicine. Almost all of them bleed, and can order a
purge, which are all the qualifications necessary for the practice of
inoculation.</p></div>

<p>And as propagandists&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No set of men have it so much in their power to render the practice
of inoculation general as the clergy, the greatest opposition to
it still arising from some scruples of conscience, which they alone
can remove. I would recommend them not only to endeavour to
remove the religious objections which weak minds have to this
salutary practice, but to enjoin it as a duty, and to point out the
danger of neglecting to make use of a means which Providence has
put in our power for saving the lives of our offspring. Surely such
parents as wilfully neglect the means of saving their children’s
lives are as guilty as those who put them to death.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>How familiar have vaccinators rendered this line of
adjuration! If you do not comply with our prescription,
and your children catch smallpox, then are you their
murderers.</p>

<p>Here is another passage from Buchan, which with
equal accuracy might apply to Vaccination&mdash;is indeed
what is perpetually asserted to be the truth concerning
Vaccination&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the Smallpox is now become an epidemical disease in most
parts of the known world, no other choice remains but to render
the malady as mild as possible. This is the only manner of extirpation
now left in our power; and though it may seem paradoxical,
the artificial method of communicating the disease, could it be
rendered universal, would amount to nearly the same thing as
rooting it out. It is a matter of small consequence whether a disease
be entirely extirpated, or rendered so mild as neither to
destroy life nor hurt the constitution; but that this may be done
by Inoculation, does not now admit of a doubt. The numbers who
die under Inoculation hardly deserve to be named. In the natural
way, one in four or five generally dies; but by Inoculation not one
of a thousand. Nay, some can boast of having inoculated ten
thousand without the loss of a single patient.</p></div>

<p>In this deliverance, Buchan did not lie, nor did he
speak for himself alone, but expressed the medical
opinion of his time, precisely as a physician of to-day
testifies concerning Vaccination. Yet we all know that
Buchan was completely at fault, and substituted what he
wished to be true for what was true.</p>

<p>I cannot leave Buchan without a few words in his
favour, for, according to his lights, he was a worthy
fellow, and the words shall be his own. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am old enough to remember the time when the success of
Inoculation was supposed to be entirely owing to the preparation
of the body, as it was called; but I am convinced that such preparation
always has done, and still does, more harm than good. <em>The
body cannot be better prepared to meet a disease, than by being in
good health.</em> Medicine may cure a disease, but it cannot mend
good health. When a person enjoys the blessing of health, he
ought never to meddle with medicine on any account whatever.</p></div>

<p>No: nor with half an inch of thread dipped in pox.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">INOCULATION ABROAD.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Before proceeding to relate how Inoculation was superseded
and ultimately suppressed in England, it may be
expedient to make some notes on the prevalence of the
practice in other lands.</p>

<p>And first in New England where, as we have seen,
Cotton Mather had precedence in subjecting the reports
of eastern inoculation to the test of western practice.
Mather and his coadjutor, Boylston, did not propose to
make inoculation habitual, but to reserve it for use in
epidemics. Sometimes years elapsed in New England
without smallpox: there were no dense urban populations
to constitute seats of zymotic disease: and to
provide perpetually against what was occasional was obviously
unnecessary. Nevertheless the colonists shared
the common disposition of the time for pottering in
remedies, and their slaves afforded convenient opportunities
for experiments in which temerity had the
sanction of beneficence. With the Whites, cleanliness,
ventilation, drainage, and pure water, were conditions of
accident rather than of providence, but with the Blacks
life was that of the stye, and the consequences in smallpox
were thought to be sufficiently accounted for by the
assertion that Negroes were constitutionally pre-disposed
to that disorder. Wherefore the Blacks from Boston to
the Spanish Main were from time to time remorselessly
inoculated, and all of them who afterwards escaped smallpox
had their immunity ascribed to their inoculation.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards, the prince of Calvinistic divines,
was killed by inoculation. There was an epidemic of
smallpox in New Jersey, and, for security, Edwards was
inoculated. The result was the generation of smallpox
in a severe form, of which he died, 22nd March, 1758,
in his 54th year. In search of a superfluous safety was
he slain. A man of the age of Edwards had little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fear from smallpox; for the disease, in the vast majority,
was an affection of the young, concerning which, as
having attained middle life, Edwards might have maintained
comparative indifference.</p>

<p>The colonists usually ascribed any outbreak of smallpox
to importation by shipping from Europe, if not
manifestly, then covertly; for, it was held that smallpox
could never be evolved spontaneously. Great pains were
therefore taken to isolate patients, and Boston and other
sea-ports had hospitals erected on sites remote from
habitation, from which a flag was displayed whenever
occupied by the sick. A physician who visited an hospital
was required to take off his wig, to change his shoes,
and to put on a gown which hung from his neck to his
ankles; and, when he came out, to wash his hands, and
be fumigated with frankincense. In setting forth these
precautions, Professor Waterhouse of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
observed in a letter to Dr. Haygarth of Chester&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot believe them altogether unnecessary. Our towns are
small, our houses scattered, most of them having a garden between
them, so that we have been able to trace the action of contagion.
We have tried many experiments with smallpox in New England,
and persuade ourselves that we have some pretensions of knowing
more of that disease than you in Europe.</p></div>

<p>During the war with England, smallpox broke out in
the American army, and inoculation was so freely resorted
to that scarcely a man escaped the lancet. Washington
had his New England soldiers inoculated at
Cambridge in 1776, and it was difficult to find men to
keep guard over the sick; that is to say, men who had
passed through smallpox and were not considered liable
to infection, a curious evidence of the rarity of the
natural disease in the communities from which the army
had been recruited.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Cotton Mather’s triumph over Boston was complete&mdash;complete
beyond his intention; for it came to be as
thoroughly inoculated as any town in these days is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
vaccinated. Dr. Waterhouse, writing on 28th October,
1788, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We find that in 1752 there were but 170 persons liable to smallpox
in Boston, and in 1754, when there was a general inoculation
in the town, I question whether there was a quarter of that number
that did not receive the infection <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ naturæ vel artis</i>. In the
years 1776, ’77, and ’78 they inoculated pretty freely throughout the
State. Two days ago, I was at the review of part of the militia of
the county of Suffolk, and of 520 men, I scarcely think there were
a hundred above twenty-five years of age that had not passed
through smallpox by means of inoculation; and of 2000 reviewed
a week or two before, in the county of Middlesex, there was not a
greater proportion of the same age liable to take the disease.
Since 1764 the dread of smallpox has lessened considerably; and
since 1778 we meet the disorder with as little fear as any people
you can mention.</p></div>

<p>In another letter, dated 15th October, 1787, the Doctor
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by
smallpox in all the four New England Governments, that is, not
one in a million of people.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></div>

<p>However it may have been elsewhere, inoculation was
conducted in Boston with a formality and deliberation
that might have satisfied Dimsdale himself. There was
an inoculation hospital erected on Sewell’s Point, which
juts into Charles River, remote by a mile and a half from
the common road, and situated in pleasant grounds with
trees and walks. Three weeks were devoted to inoculation
and the subsequent sickness, and before dismissal,
wrote Dr. Waterhouse&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The patients are washed all over in soap suds, then rubbed with
brandy, and lastly washed in vinegar; they put on fresh clothes,
and bury those they wore during their stay in the hospital. But
even then they are smoked and fumigated with sulphur in the
smoke-house, which is about twice the size of a common sentry-box.
This smoke-house has a hole in its side for the patient to
put his head out of during the operation. Although this seems
formidable on paper, yet patients submit cheerfully, and with no
slight merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>There are perhaps 150 under inoculation at present at Sewell’s
Point, not one of them paupers. They are principally children,
perhaps thirty or forty of them of the first people in the commonwealth.
The charge for the whole process is 8 dollars, or 36s.
sterling, including every expense from incision to dismission. In
some places they inoculate for half that sum. You must conceive
the whole business conducted with a good deal of gaiety, where a
patient, when ill, is as apt to be pitied as if sea-sick with a sailing
party. The established system of mirth and good humour contributes
not a little to the welfare of the patients.</p></div>

<p>It is a curious story, and stands in broad contrast to
the rough and ready practice of Turkey, and of many
inoculators in England and elsewhere. Dr. Waterhouse
adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There were a considerable number of persons in Boston to whom
smallpox could not be communicated by inoculation. In some the
operation was repeated two, three, and four times with fresh
matter. Several of these have had the disease severely since in
the natural way, and some have died of it.</p></div>

<p>France was slow to accept inoculation. After its introduction
in 1723, about thirty years elapsed without
any serious movement in its favour, when Voltaire,
Diderot, and their set began to recommend the practice,
which had the merit of being English and disliked by
those who held change and improvement in aversion.
La Condamine read an eloquent paper on the advantages
of inoculation before the Academy of Sciences; and
Turgot, the ardent and sagacious lover of his kind, procured
the inoculation of a child in Paris, 1st April, 1755;
which was followed on 14th May by a young man,
named Chastellux, submitting himself to the operation
in the interest of the common welfare. Then Dr. Hosty
was sent to London to investigate and report, and on his
return issued these statements&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That out of 463 cases inoculated in the London Hospital, only
one had been unsuccessful; whereas in the Smallpox Hospital
nearly one in four had died.</p>

<p>2. That Mr. Ranby, principal surgeon to his majesty, had inoculated
1600 persons, and Mr. Bell 903, without the loss of one.</p>

<p>3. That to form a just comparison between the fatality of natural
and artificial smallpox, it is only necessary to visit the London
Smallpox Hospital and then the Inoculation Hospital: the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
between the two is so remarkable that the most incredulous must
be convinced.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, with respect to the asserted insemination of other
diseases with inoculated smallpox: no instance of the kind has ever
been produced. Persons have been inoculated with variolous
matter taken from patients afflicted with venereal disease, yet they
have received no infection save that of smallpox only.</p></div>

<p>It would be superfluous to deal with the fallacies involved
in these statements: they served to satisfy those
who were disposed to be satisfied, and inoculation became
the fashion among the scientific and enlightened. Dr.
Tronchin, a well-known inoculator, was summoned from
Geneva to Paris in 1756 to operate upon the children of
the Duke of Orleans, and his success was pronounced
decisive. Nevertheless inoculation did not extend beyond
people of leisure and culture, and in 1763 an outbreak of
smallpox in Paris made an end of the practice. An inquiry
was instituted by the authorities, and the evidence
left no doubt that the epidemic had been diffused, if it
did not originate, with the artificially poxed; and inoculation
was thenceforth prohibited in Paris. Any citizen
who was resolved to have the induced disease had to
retire to country quarters.</p>

<p>Here we may observe that the confidence of the inoculator
was grounded on the assumption that whoever
had once passed through smallpox, whether natural or
artificial, could never again contract the disease. Nevertheless
the inoculated did contract the disease, and the
disaster was uniformly accounted for as due to some
imperfection in the inoculation. There were also instances
of smallpox after smallpox, but these, too, were
discredited; the first smallpox could not have been smallpox,
but chickenpox, measles, or some other eruptive
disorder. There was a conspicuous confutation of these
evasions in the case of Louis XV. He had smallpox
unquestionably in his 14th year, and of unquestionable
smallpox he died in 1774 in his 64th year. Notwithstanding,
the assertion was perpetuated that there was
no possibility of smallpox after smallpox, and it was
only when it became necessary to maintain the credit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
vaccination that the facts were admitted; and in this
form&mdash;Smallpox after vaccination is no more common or
extraordinary than smallpox after smallpox&mdash;a falsehood
on the back of a former falsehood.</p>

<p>We have seen under what safeguards inoculation was
practised in Boston, and now we shall turn to Geneva
and discover how all the American precautions were set
at naught in that city with apparent impunity. The
details are from a letter of the Council of Geneva, dated
24th December, 1791, addressed to Dr. Haygarth in
answer to his inquiries and suggestions. Des Gouttes,
secretary to the Geneva Syndic, wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I.&mdash;The Republic of Geneva contains about 35,000 inhabitants,
of whom 26,000 dwell in the city, and 9,000 in the adjacent country.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;The city is of small extent, and ill adapted to so large a
population; and its extension is not easy on account of the fortifications
wherewith it is surrounded. There are little more than 1200
houses in the city, which are built in many storeys of many apartments
like the ancient part of Edinburgh, each house sheltering on
an average twenty-one inhabitants.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;A great part of the population consists of strangers, not
only because most of our servants and labourers are natives of other
countries, but because Geneva being a frontier city, girt about by
Savoy, Switzerland, and France, and situated on the highways of
intercourse between these states, travellers are always coming and
going.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;Notwithstanding this continual resort of strangers within
our walls, an epidemic of smallpox is of almost regular occurrence
every five years; and between the epidemics it frequently happens
that we have no natural smallpox whatever, either in the city or
its vicinity.</p>

<p>V.&mdash;Inoculation began to be practised here in 1751, since which
date we have inoculated a very large number of children annually,
and with such marked success that the deaths have but slightly
exceeded 1 in 300. Although we have often had to inoculate with
pus brought from a distance at times when there was no smallpox
to be found in the city, and although children so inoculated have
gone freely into the streets, walks, and other public places, before,
during, and after the eruption, we have never observed that they
were sources of contagion, nor that they produced any intermediate
epidemic, nor that they accelerated the return of the periodical
epidemic.</p>

<p>VI.&mdash;Lastly, our citizens enjoy a republican constitution which
requires us to pay most scrupulous regard to the liberty of every
individual. No coercive measures to hinder the introduction or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
communication of smallpox are here practicable; and we believe we
ought to limit our action to advice, and to simple precautions of
police, which must not, nor even seem to be, oppressive to the
citizens.</p></div>

<p>This glimpse into old Geneva is not only instructive
as concerns inoculation, but it is another exposure of the
monstrous fable that represents European cities as decimated
with smallpox until Jenner’s advent as saviour&mdash;a
fable that vanishes like smoke whenever brought
into contact with matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>Inoculation was introduced to Rome and Florence
during a severe epidemic in 1754; and attention being
drawn to the remedy, it was discovered that the Italian
peasantry had long practised voluntary smallpox just as
did the peasantry of Wales and the Highlands of Scotland.
In Spain, inoculation made little headway: in the
words of Moore&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some inoculations were effected in a few trading cities, which
held communication with England; but these efforts were of short
duration, and from the distinguished inaction of the Spaniards,
inoculation was soon relinquished; and no other country in Europe
has suffered so little from smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p></div>

<p>In Holland and Denmark inoculation acquired a certain
vogue among the upper classes, and in Germany
the like was true to a less extent. In Sweden inoculation
was encouraged by the Court, and Dr. Schultz was
deputed to visit the London Hospital. His report was so
favourable that in 1755 inoculation houses were opened
in several parts of the kingdom, and the benefits of the
practice were commemorated by a medal in 1757&mdash;a
curious trophy of illusion under prepossession.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable event in the story of inoculation
was its introduction into Russia: how it was
brought about is thus described by Mr. Morley&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As soon as Catharine came into power (1762), she at once applied
herself to make friends in this powerful region [French letters and
philosophy]. It was a matter of course that she should begin with
the omnipotent monarch at Ferney. Graceful verses from Voltaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
were as indispensable an ornament to a crowned head as a diadem,
and Catharine answered with compliments that were perhaps more
sincere than his verses. She wonders how she can repay him for
a bundle of books that he had sent to her, and at last bethinks
herself that nothing will please the lover of mankind so much as
the introduction of inoculation into the great Empire; so she sends
for Dr. Dimsdale from England, and submits to the unfamiliar rite
in her own sacred person.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></div>

<p>One day in the summer of 1768, at his house in Hertford,
Dimsdale received an unexpected message from
Pouschin, the Russian minister in London, to wait upon
him; and in his presence he learnt that he was required
to proceed at once to St. Petersburg to inoculate the
Empress. There was of course some hesitation about
undertaking so long a journey, but Pouschin had been
authorised to overcome all obstacles. What would the
Doctor require in the way of expenses? The Doctor
discreetly answered that he would leave that to her
Imperial Majesty, whereon Pouschin handed him £1000
to pay his way to St. Petersburg. Dimsdale summoned
his son from his medical studies in Edinburgh, and the
two set off for the North on the 28th of July.</p>

<p>At St. Petersburg Dimsdale was received with every
mark of respect and liberal hospitality. He was introduced
to the Empress, who was charming and gracious;
and he was instructed to make the requisite preparations
for the serious duty before him. He had to find pus,
and to obtain pus he had to lay hands on a suitable
sufferer from smallpox&mdash;a task which proved by no means
easy. Having discovered a case to his mind, he had then
to overcome an obstinate objection to the abstraction of
virus. He had, at the same time, to find a couple of
healthy young men, who had not had smallpox, on whom
to raise secondary virus, for the Empress could not be
expected to run the risk of smallpox without mitigation.
His first attempt was a complete failure, and he had to
report accordingly to his expectant patient. Catharine
heard his report with philosophical equanimity, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him to try again. At last he was successful, and at the
palace of Czarscoe Selo on Saturday, 11th October, 1768,
the Empress swallowed five grains of mercurial powder,
and late on Sunday evening Dimsdale inoculated her
with fluid matter by one puncture in each arm. She did
well. From the time of the inoculation to the commencement
of the eruption, she walked every day for two or
three hours in the open air, and, on the 1st November,
she returned to St. Petersburg “in perfect good health,
to the great joy of the whole city.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The Grand Duke
was inoculated on the 30th October, and by the 22nd
November had “perfectly recovered.”</p>

<p>The Empress having played, the nobility had to follow
suit, and Dimsdale was requested to proceed to Moscow
to take them in hand; but at this time there was a new
difficulty. There was said to be no smallpox in Moscow,
and as Dimsdale could not inoculate without fresh virus,
he had to inoculate two girls in St. Petersburg, designing
so to time their disorder that he should arrive with them
in Moscow in prime condition for business. One girl was
a failure, and mishaps and delays on the sledge journey
almost made a failure of the other. He did, however,
reach Moscow in time enough to communicate the requisite
infection to fifty patients, and in Moscow he
remained for two months operating and playing the lion.
Then he set off for home, and on his route through St.
Petersburg found Catharine suffering from pleurisy, for
which he bled her, drawing eight ounces of imperial blood.
Then came the reckoning. In substantials he had&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80 pad4">
£10,000 down;<br />
£2,000 for travelling expenses;<br />
£500 a year for life, to be paid in net English cash, and<br />
A superb gold snuff-box set with diamonds for Mr. Dimsdale.<br />
</div>

<p>In honours he had the appointments of&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80 pad4">
Counsellor of State;<br />
Physician to her Imperial Majesty; and<br />
Baron of the Russian Empire with descent of title to his eldest son.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a barbarian’s style of recompense, paid under
the eye of Europe. It cost Catharine nothing, for it is
subjects who suffer for the extravagance of despots.</p>

<p>Dimsdale had plans for the systematic inoculation of
Russia, but they resulted in little. Catharine’s purpose
was sufficiently served in the display she had made; and
possibly she came to consider Dimsdale an appendage of
that deceiver Voltaire, whose busts, that had adorned
her saloons and corridors, were by her orders thrown into
the cellars when the French revolution opened her eyes
to the consequences of French philosophy.</p>

<p>In perusing the literature of inoculation, nothing impresses
a reader, enlightened by sanitary science, so much
as the manner in which smallpox was regarded as something
like hail or lightning that might be averted, but
could not be prevented. So far, I have not met with
even a hint in that literature that smallpox was either
induced by unwholesome modes of life, or that it could
be avoided by wholesome modes. In conjunction with
this blindness was the amazing assumption of the inoculators,
that every one inoculated was to be placed to their
credit as saved from smallpox; as if (granting inoculation
to be prophylactic) smallpox was ever a universal epidemic,
and as if multitudes did not pass through life
without smallpox before inoculation was heard of. The
true problem to be set and solved in all epidemics,
whether of influenza or smallpox, is why some are susceptible
and some insusceptible, and whether it is not
practicable so to modify conditions as to carry over the
susceptible to the ranks of the insusceptible.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">INOCULATION SUPERSEDED AND SUPPRESSED.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The illusory character of human testimony is graphically
illustrated in the case of inoculation. Suppose an inquirer
wished to ascertain the ratio of deaths to inoculations,
he would be completely bewildered. We have
seen what Dr. Buchan wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the natural way, one in four or five generally dies of smallpox;
but by inoculation not one of a thousand. Nay, some can
boast of having inoculated ten thousand without the loss of a
single patient.</p></div>

<p>John Birch, an eminent London surgeon, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not one in three hundred dies of inoculation in the general
irregular mode of proceeding, and not one in a thousand among
observant practitioners; and if the inoculated patient die, he dies
of smallpox and of nothing but smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></div>

<p>In the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, October, 1806, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of those who have smallpox naturally, one is found to die in six.
Of inoculated patients, only one dies in two hundred and fifty.
This at least is Dr. Willan’s calculation; and we are persuaded
that it is very near the truth. In London, where it ought to be
best ascertained, some eminent practitioners have stated the proportion
to be so high as one in the hundred. The zealous anti-vaccinists
have denied it to be greater, under judicious treatment,
than one in a thousand. It cannot be denied, however, that besides
the risk to life, the disease, even under the mitigated form,
has frequently proved an exciting cause of scrofula and other
dreadful distempers, and has often been attended with blindness
and deformity.</p></div>

<p>In Reynolds’s <cite>System of Medicine</cite>, it is stated by
Marson that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital was founded in London
in 1746, and inoculation was continued there until 1822. Dr.
Gregory went carefully over the records of the Hospital for that
period of seventy-six years, and found that only three in a thousand
died of inoculation. The inoculated disease was usually very mild,
but not invariably so.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Scores of such testimonies might be adduced, twitching
the reader from conclusion to conclusion; and in the
conflict of authorities what is to be said? It is true that
if we select what evidence we like, and call it sound, and
reject what we dislike, and call it unsound, we may prove
anything; but it is also true, that if we are to be fettered
by evidence we shall stand paralysed amid contradictions.
When men who are competent, and obviously honest,
deliver varying testimony, we are driven to seek some
method of reconciliation; and in this matter of Inoculation
wherein our resort is to books, and about which
we can have no immediate experience, we may derive
much light from the corresponding practice of Vaccination.
Thus, what is commoner than for vaccinators to
assert, that never within their sphere of observation have
they witnessed a single case of injury resulting from
Vaccination&mdash;not one! Subject any dozen ordinary
practitioners to judicial examination, and they would
thus testify with scarcely a note of variation. On the
other hand, take any dozen mothers of families, especially
from among the poor, and they would tell of illness, disease,
and death following the vaccinators’ lancets. The
men are more or less competent and honest, and the
women likewise, and how shall we account for their variance?
In the first place, the men have been drilled from
the outset of their profession into the conviction that
Vaccination is absolutely harmless, and if any disaster
follows, it is coincidence, not consequence. Occasionally
a practitioner of more vigorous intelligence than the
average, like Mr. Henry May of Birmingham, sees what
the mothers see, but does he report accordingly? Not
at all. In Mr. May’s own words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A death from Vaccination occurred not long ago in my practice,
and although I had not vaccinated the child, yet in my desire to
preserve Vaccination from reproach, I omitted all mention of it
from my certificate of death.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. May recognised the fact and concealed it: a duller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
man would have ascribed the death mechanically to erysipelas
or pyœmia. Indeed, it is a commonplace with
medical men, that no child dies of Vaccination; and
hence Vaccination is not an admitted cause of death; and
when the fact is insisted upon, there is no limit to the
hardihood wherewith the truth is crushed down and
covered up. Coroners refuse to hold inquests on children
slain by Vaccination, and Dr. Lankester, as coroner for
Middlesex, did not hesitate to authorise a false certificate
of death in order, like Mr. May, “to preserve Vaccination
from reproach.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> As for mothers, poor creatures, few
of them have minds of their own, and if only they were
adequately assured that it was for the good of their
offspring that their noses should be slit, they would
believe, weep, and submit.</p>

<p>But it will be pointed out that inoculators of the more
reasonable sort admitted a certain mortality from the
practice. It is so; but the admission was unavoidable.
Inoculation communicated smallpox, and there was no
evasion of the fact that occasionally the malady assumed
a severe form, and the patient died. For such mishaps,
however, there were always excuses. The patient was
not in a suitable condition of body; he had been eating
improperly; he had caught cold; and so on. There remained,
nevertheless, the sequelæ of Inoculation, which
were just as persistently denied as are those of Vaccination,
although there were always clear-sighted observers
who maintained that it was impossible to infect the blood
with a complex organic virus, and that it should exhaust
its effects in a single and definite issue. We all remember
how we used to be assured with contemptuous emphasis
that it was utterly impossible to communicate Syphilis
by Vaccination, and that assertions to the contrary were
the fables of ignorance and malice; yet, we see that
what was fabulous a few years ago, is now accepted as
medical matter-of-fact. Nowhere is scepticism so useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
as among physicians; for whenever they protest most,
suspect most.</p>

<p>With the close of the 18th Century, Inoculation with
smallpox to avert smallpox was accepted as sound practice
throughout England. Its safety and efficiency were
extolled by medical writers in terms curiously identical
with those applied to Vaccination. The objectors were
few, and for pious rather than physiological reasons; and
the question that exercised practical and benevolent
minds was how to universalise the remedy, which, on
account of its troublesome accompaniments, was chiefly
confined to the upper and middle classes. On this
point it may be well to cite the words of Dr. Haygarth
of Chester, who, in a letter to the Council of Health of
Geneva, dated 10th February, 1792, thus sets forth the
position of affairs&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Chester, and, I believe, in most of the large towns of England,
the casual smallpox is almost constantly present. <em>All the children
of the middle and higher ranks of our citizens are inoculated
in early infancy.</em> The populace, very generally regarding the
distemper as inevitable, neither fear nor shun it; but much more
frequently by voluntary and intentional intercourse, endeavour to
catch the casual infection. All the difficulties of our Smallpox
Society in Chester proceeded from this strange delusion and perversity
of disposition. With us the smallpox is seldom or never
heard of except in the Bills of Mortality; but there its devastation
appears dreadful indeed.</p></div>

<p>The strong objection to Inoculation was, that it diffused
the disease generally which it was supposed to avert
individually. Inoculators tried to minimise and deny
the danger, but in vain; and nothing so contributed to
the supersession of the practice by Vaccination as the
expectation of escape from the artificially propagated
disease. How extensive was that propagation, we leave
the writer in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> of 1806 to describe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inoculated smallpox is an infectious disease, and those who
take it naturally from an inoculated patient have it as violently as
if they had been infected from a case of spontaneous disease; it is
to all intents and purposes the natural smallpox again in them.
Now, if it be considered that several hundred thousand persons
have been annually inoculated in these Kingdoms for the last fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
years, it will be easy to calculate the immense addition that must
have been made in that period to the cases of actual disease, and
the increase of natural smallpox that may be supposed to have
arisen from this constant multiplication of the sources and centres
of infection.</p></div>

<p>Unless this culture and this traffic in smallpox throughout
the United Kingdom be realised, the potent cause of
the immediate and extravagant success of Vaccination
will be left out of reckoning. When we are harassed,
anxious and impatient under some course of conduct,
our ears are open to any promise of relief; and it was to
a generation so afflicted and so receptive that Jenner in
1798 made his revelation of the virtue of cowpox. No
more need, said he, to inoculate with smallpox. Substitute
cowpox; and whilst it will protect as effectually,
it will inflict no injury and diffuse no infection. The
revelation was received with acclamation, and within
eighteen months of its delivery (without due experience,
and without any warrant that could pass muster in
the severe realm of science) the leading physicians and
surgeons of London subscribed and published the following
manifesto in the newspapers of 1800&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, the undersigned physicians and surgeons, think it our duty
to declare our opinion, that those persons who have had the Cowpox
are perfectly secure from the infection of the Smallpox, provided
this infection has not been previously communicated.</p></div>

<p>I do not wish to anticipate the wondrous tale of
Jenner&mdash;my present purpose is to show how Inoculation
was set aside; and it suffices to state that cowpox rapidly
made an end of inoculation with smallpox. Indeed, I
question whether a revolution in practice was ever
effected with similar facility. Within eight years of
the delivery of Jenner’s revelation, the writer in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> of 1806, already cited, was able to
testify&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bitterest enemies of Vaccination will not deny, that more
than nine-tenths of the medical world are decidedly and zealously
in favour of it, and that all their demonstrations of its dangers and
terrors have been insufficient to convert a single one of their brethren
from so damnable and dangerous a heresy. Testimonies, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
may be said, should be weighed, and not numbered; and in this
respect the vaccinators, we are afraid, will have a splendid and
indisputable triumph. We give the anti-vaccinists all the advantage
in our power when we assign to them a few members of the
profession in London; for in the country at large, we believe, they
have not one respectable practitioner on their side in five hundred.
In this great city and school of medicine [Edinburgh] we are assured,
they are without a single public adherent.</p></div>

<p>The resistance to Vaccination was almost entirely confined
to the resistance of inoculators, who were too deeply
compromised by their own disloyalty to Nature, to make
effective resistance. They were steadily borne down by
the vaccinators, many of whom had been energetic inoculators,
and displayed the usual ardour of apostates in
condemning what they had formerly approved. Indeed,
when we consider how Inoculation was commended for
its efficiency and harmlessness by the same medical
authorities who, within a year or two after Jenner’s
appearance, denounced the practice for its difficulties
and dangers, their tergiversation appears little short of
shameless. Dr. Lettsom had been an inoculator, yet on
2nd July, 1805, he felt warranted in writing&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What have not the abettors of Variolous Inoculation to answer
for? To shoot a dozen or two innocent people in the public
streets of London would not be half so injurious as allowing the
murderers to kill the rising generation, the future hope of the
State. Nothing can show the supineness and ignorance of the
Government more than legalising these Variolous Murders.</p></div>

<p>How far the conquest of the inoculators by the vaccinators
had advanced, appeared in a debate in the
House of Commons in 1806, when Wilberforce urged
that Inoculation should be suppressed, or at least that
those who insisted on Inoculation should be compelled
to place their patients in quarantine. Mr. Windham
admitted the scandal of wretched and miserable subjects
of Inoculation being carried about in the streets, but
he hesitated to recommend coercive legislation until
persuasion had been fully tried and had failed. Dr.
Matthews, M.P. for Hereford, took occasion at the same
time to run with the hounds. Inoculation, he said, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
frequent cause of disfigurement and of death in its most
awful form; it was a magazine of the most dreadful
evils; a magnifier of mortality; and a means of introducing
scrofula, a more dangerous and pernicious disorder
than smallpox itself&mdash;facts which it would have been
more creditable to have proclaimed when Inoculation was
in fashion. It is so easy to kick when a foe has fallen,
and where all are kicking. Human nature is never so
despicable as when thus engaged.</p>

<p>The question of restraining Inoculation came again
before the House of Commons in 1807, when the practice
of inoculating out-patients at the London dispensaries
and hospitals was energetically condemned. “I think
that the legislature,” said Mr. Sturges Bourne, “would
be as much justified in taking a measure to prevent this
evil by restraint, as a man would be in snatching a fire-brand
out of the hands of a maniac just as he was going
to set fire to a city.”</p>

<p>No one was more eager to suppress Inoculation by
force than Jenner himself, and in July 1807, he sought
an interview with the Premier for the purpose. In a
letter to Dr. Lettsom he thus describes his mortification&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will be sorry to hear the result of my interview with the
Minister, Mr. Perceval. I solicited this honour with the sole view
of inquiring whether it was the intention of Government to give a
check to the licentious manner in which Smallpox Inoculation is at
this time conducted in the metropolis. I instanced the mortality
it occasioned in language as forcible as I could utter, and showed
him clearly that it was the great source from which the pest of
smallpox was disseminated through the country as well as through
the town. But, alas! all I said availed nothing, and the speckled
monster is still to have the liberty that the Smallpox Hospital, the
delusions of Moseley, and the caprices and prejudices of the misguided
poor, can possibly give him. I cannot express to you the
chagrin and disappointment I felt at this interview.</p></div>

<p>We are not accustomed to regard politicians of Perceval’s
order as favourable to liberty; and yet it is refreshing
to remark in even the Tories of the Georgian age a
jealous regard for the personal freedom of Englishmen,
and a hearty contempt for the plausible quacks who
were always contriving to circumscribe it. Perceval was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
not opposed to Vaccination, but he would not consent to
give it an illicit advantage over Inoculation. If it were
the good thing it was asserted to be, it might be left to
prevail by reason of its own quality.</p>

<p>Under medical and social pressure, the practice of Inoculation
at public institutions was gradually abandoned.
On 5th May, 1808, the inoculation of out-patients was
discontinued at the London Smallpox Hospital, but not
until 20th of June, 1822, did the inoculation of in-patients
cease. In 1816 the Colleges of Surgeons of
London and Dublin pledged themselves against the practice.
A formal attempt at coercive legislation, often
called for, was at last made by the directors of the
National Vaccine Establishment. They framed and promoted
a bill, which was introduced to the House of
Lords in 1813 by Lord Boringdon, but it was ignominiously
withdrawn in 1814&mdash;a choice example of grand-motherly
legislation. Among its provisions was the
enactment that whenever an inoculation took place, the
clergyman of the parish should receive notice, and that
red flags should be displayed from the house where the
patient lay! As Earl Stanhope observed, instead of
being a measure of humanity, it would, if passed into
law, be one of the most troublesome, inconvenient, and
mischievous ever enacted.</p>

<p>In the discussion on this foolish project, Lord Eldon
pointed out that the common law was already sufficient
to arrest the exposure of sufferers from infectious disease;
and acting on the hint the Vaccine Establishment
prosecuted a woman, 27th April, 1815, for carrying her
inoculated child covered with pustules through the
streets of her neighbourhood. Evidence was adduced
that she had thus infected eleven persons with smallpox
of whom eight had died. The Court of King’s Bench
pronounced her conduct illegal and criminal, but as it
was the first prosecution for such an offence, she was let
off with a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>A practice thus banned could not long survive in
England, and by and by a medical man who would consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to inoculate became a rarity, or was accounted disreputable.
Yet there remained old-fashioned folk who
would have nothing to do with cowpox, and insisted on
having genuine human pox for their children and grandchildren.
Hence Dr. Epps writing in 1831 had to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a class of medical practitioners who inoculate for the
smallpox. Society should utter its voice of moral indignation
against such individuals, who glory in anything by which they can
claim singularity, or by which they can increase their pecuniary
means. Let not society be deceived into any parley with such
practices upon the plea, that parents <em>will</em> have their children
inoculated with the smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></div>

<p>Gradually the inoculating practitioner ceased, and the
practice remained in the hands of “ignorant and unqualified
persons, old women, and itinerant quacks;”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and then the end came. An Act of Parliament was
passed in 1840 wherein it was enacted that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Any person who shall produce or attempt to produce in any
person by inoculation with variolous matter, or by wilful exposure
to variolous matter, or to any matter, article, or thing impregnated
with variolous matter, or wilfully by any other means whatsoever
produce the disease of smallpox in any person in England, Wales,
or Ireland, shall be liable to be proceeded against and convicted
summarily before any two or more justices of the peace in petty
sessions assembled, and for every such offence shall, upon conviction,
be imprisoned in the common gaol or house of correction for
any term not exceeding one month.</p></div>

<p>The Government did not at first intend to make the
prohibition absolute, but Mr. Wakley insisted that the
time had arrived to suppress the nuisance summarily,
and that not a voice would be raised in opposition. Nor
was there any opposition. Mr. Goulburn expressed some
hesitation, but the House was practically unanimous.</p>

<p>Outside the House few regrets were expressed. Dr.
George Gregory, physician of the Smallpox Hospital at
St. Pancras, was, however, a man of philosophic turn,
and he did not see the old idol cast down unmoved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On 23rd July, 1840 [he wrote], the practice of inoculation, the
introduction of which has conferred immortality on the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, which had been sanctioned by the
College of Physicians, which had saved the lives of many kings,
queens, and princes, and of thousands of their subjects, during the
greater part of the preceding century, was declared illegal by the
English Parliament, and all offenders were to be sent to prison,
with a good chance of the tread-mill. Such are the reverses of
fortune to which all sublunary things are doomed.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></div>

<p>Gregory was not blind to the extravagant claims made
for Vaccination, and evidently had a lurking conviction
that all was not gain in the substitution of the new
practice for the old, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had not the discovery of Jenner interfered to interrupt its
extension and improvement, Inoculation would have continued to
this day increasing yearly in popularity.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div>

<p>Yet was not Inoculation abolished. Sometimes when
we get the devil out at the door, he presently re-enters
by the window; and thus while Parliament was making
an end of Inoculation in one form, it was reviving in
another.</p>

<p>It is to be understood that Jenner’s cowpox, whatever
it might be, was an uncommon and erratic disease, and
its discovery and maintenance difficult. To provide a
substitute, cows were from time to time inoculated with
smallpox, and the resulting virus was used instead of the
Jennerian specific. Lest one should be accused of questionable
witness, let us refer to Dr. Seaton’s <cite>Handbook
of Vaccination</cite>. There we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Ceely of Aylesbury in February, 1839, succeeded in inducing
vaccine vesicles on two sturks by inoculation with variolous lymph,
and in thus establishing lymph-stocks, which passed at once into
extensive use, so that, in a few months, more than 2000 children
had been vaccinated from them. In December, 1840, Mr. Badcock
succeeded in variolating a cow at Brighton, and deriving therefrom
a stock of genuine vaccine lymph. In this manner he has raised
stocks of vaccine lymph for use on no fewer than thirty-seven separate
occasions. The lymph thus obtained by him is now largely
employed; it has been supplied to many hundreds of practitioners,
and very many thousands of children have been vaccinated with
it. Mr. Ceely’s experiments were repeated in America in 1852 by
Dr. Adams of Waltham, and Dr. Putnam of Boston, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
able, it is said, to furnish the city and neighbourhood of Boston
with all the vaccine matter used there since that period.</p></div>

<p>Again, Sir John Cordy Burrows, a surgeon, speaking
as a magistrate, at Brighton on 5th February, 1876,
observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The public seem scarcely to understand what Vaccination means.
The vaccine lymph taken from a child is nothing more than what
has passed from a smallpox patient through a cow. In 1856-58 I
took an active part in inoculating seventeen cows with smallpox,
producing in three cases vaccine lymph, and from these the world
has been supplied.</p></div>

<p>Thus, as asserted, has Inoculation been revived, and
Jenner’s specific set aside. When Dimsdale had Russian
nobles to operate upon, he tried to mollify the smallpox
by passing it through healthy children. Cows have now
taken the place of children, and the virus in its passage
from arm to arm may still further be reduced in virulence,
when it does not take up fresh malignities such as
syphilis; but it is inoculation with smallpox all the
same.</p>

THE 18TH CENTURY.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The exact truth as to the prevalence of smallpox in the
18th Century is not attainable; vital statistics were
undeveloped; and in the absence of precision the imaginative
revel. M.D.’s and M.P.’s shut their eyes, tilt
their noses skyward, and prophesy concerning the frightful
ravages, and the salvation wrought by the revered
and immortal Jenner. Any extravagance, as to the
ravages, or as to the salvation, is accepted as laudable
zeal for humanity. “Decimation” is a favourite word
in this connection without any sense of its definite
meaning. “What family before 1800 ever escaped decimation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
from smallpox?” asks Dr. Granville. “Smallpox
decimated the country in olden times,” says Dr.
Chavasse; “it ravaged like a plague, whilst Inoculation
caused the disease to spread like wild-fire;” adding as a
sequence, “Vaccination is an important cause of our
increasing population.” In the same temper, Lord Chief
Justice Cockburn described an unvaccinated infant as
“a centre of contagion;” and as the folly of the great is
intensified in the little, Mr. Bompas, Q.C., informed the
electors of Marylebone, that “a person not vaccinated is
like a flaming fire-brand among the people.” Thus the
infants of last century were “centres of contagion;” the
adults were “flaming fire-brands;” whilst England was
“decimated” with smallpox diffused like wild-fire by
inoculation. What a picture of 18th Century England
painted by Rant and illuminated by Delirium!</p>

<p>The tendency of excess on one side is to provoke to excess
on the other, but the extravagance of these popular
fables ought to put us in love with homely matter-of-fact&mdash;wherein
indeed is the true extreme of these frantic
inventions. What was the extent of smallpox in England
last century is the question. With accuracy, we do
not know. The common estimates (when not evolved
from inner consciousness) are based on the London
Bills of Mortality, and when these Bills are scrutinised
we find nothing to justify the opinion that the community
was harassed and devastated by smallpox over
other ailments. In the first place, we have to remark
that the exact population of the metropolis was unknown.
Some say it was 500,000 in 1701, and others 700,000.
In 1751 it was generally reckoned at 750,000, and in
1801 it was said to be 958,863. Then we have to consider
that the increase, whatever it might be, lay only
partially within the Bills of Mortality, for several rising
quarters were outside the boundaries, and there were extensive
exemptions within. Thus, so late as 1818, we
find Dr. Burrows writing&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The parishes of Marylebone, Pancras, Chelsea, Kensington, and
Paddington, now forming an integral part of the metropolis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
containing a population of 160,000 are not within the Bills of Mortality,
and make no returns. Neither are there any returns from
St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the Temple Church, the
Rolls and Lincoln’s Inn Chapels, the Chapter House, the Tower
Church, and various other places of worship of the Established Church.
Besides, neither Dissenters, Papists or Jews who have burying places
of their own, are included in the Bills. Many of the wealthier
classes when they die are removed for interment into the country;
nor do they appear in the Bills.</p></div>

<p>With omissions so serious, the Bills are obviously
worth little as registers of the number of deaths in any
year in London; and when we inquire how far they may
be trusted as indicating the relative prevalence of certain
forms of disease, we find them equally questionable. Dr.
Burrows thus describes the method by which the causes
of death were ascertained&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Diseases as specified in the Bills are a disgrace to the medical
science and civilisation in which as a nation we are acknowledged
pre-eminent; nor can any effective reform take place while the
sources of information are so ignorant and venal as at present.
The information as to the disease of which any person dies is collected
and verified in the following way.&mdash;The Churchwardens of
each parish within the Bills of Mortality appoint two old women
to the office of Searchers. These women as soon as they hear the
knell for the dead, repair to the sexton of the parish to learn the
residence of the deceased. They demand admittance into the house
to examine the body in order that they may see that there is nothing
suspicious about it, and <em>judge</em> of what disease the person died; and
<em>they</em> report to the parish clerk. The regular charge for the performance
of this office is 4d. to each Searcher; but if an extra
gratuity be tendered, they seldom pass the threshold or hall of the
house, and are content with whatever account is given; or should
they actually view the corpse, it is easy to imagine what credit is
due to the judgment they pronounce.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></div>

<p>In presence of defects so grave as to the number of the
dead, and of diagnosis so grotesque as to the causes of
death, it would be unwise to argue with any confidence
from the data of these Bills; yet, such as they are, we have
nothing else to appeal to. The variations of mortality
from year to year were of wide irregularity; and whatever
influence smallpox might have had, it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
appear to have had much in magnifying the annual totals.
Let us take a dozen years when smallpox was heaviest
from the last seventy years of the century, and observe
its relation to the entire mortality, and to that from
fevers&mdash;</p>

<p>We thus see that in twelve years when the death-rate
from smallpox was highest, as many died of fevers as of
smallpox; and in twelve years when the death-rate from
smallpox was lowest, there died thrice as many of fevers
as of smallpox. Again, we have to remark, that, on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
average of all the years, smallpox was accountable for
something less than a tenth of the total mortality. Also
we have to note, that the mortality from smallpox was
in great part infant mortality, and that there is reason to
believe measles was extensively confounded with smallpox.
The infant mortality was prodigious. Rarely a
year passed in which a fourth of the deaths was not set
down to Convulsions&mdash;that is, to babes killed by improper
feeding. In 1772 (the worst smallpox year of
the century when 3,992 died) there were, 6,605 ascribed
to Convulsions, the total mortality being 26,053.</p>

<p>Now I have no wish to minimise the London smallpox
of last century, nor even to set 1797, when 522
died, against 1796, when 3548 died. I yield to none in
detestation of smallpox as a preventible and therefore
disgraceful affliction. Let so much pass for granted;
but do not let us in any access of sanitary fury lose alike
eyes and reason and rave like maniacs. If smallpox was
bad, fevers were worse, and as both had a common origin,
why should we make a wanton and unscientific distinction
between them?</p>

<p>That smallpox should have been constantly present in
London throughout last century was in nowise surprising.
The citizens lived in a manner to invite and maintain
fevers. I shall refer to their food and drink presently,
and would now call attention to the fact that they were
a stay-at-home generation almost beyond present-day
belief. Cowper did not violate credibility when he
sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,</p>
<p class="verse2">“Though wedded we have been</p>
<p class="verse0">These twice ten tedious years, yet we</p>
<p class="verse2">No holiday have seen.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>They had no ready means of locomotion, and indeed
did not think of fresh air and exercise. An apprentice
or maid from the country entered London and was immured
as in a prison. We know how the lower orders
in our own time huddle together like pigs, unless so far
as restrained by lodging-house law, but middle-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Londoners a century ago utilised their apartments, with
more decency perhaps, but with equal ignorance of the
virtue of oxygen. The Londoners were a densely compacted
community, and at night the streets and lanes of
the city were almost as thickly tenanted as a man-of-war,
but without benefit of sea-air. A Quaker told me that
he served his apprenticeship to a grocer in Cheapside
between 1786 and 1793, that the shop was opened at
seven in the morning and closed at ten at night, that he
slept under the counter, that his ablutions were limited
to his countenance, and that he never went out except to
meeting on First Days; adding, that he had no sense of
being hardly dealt with; it was the custom of the time,
and he was as his fellows. Memoirs of the 18th century
prove that he spoke the simple truth. Bishop Wilson of
Calcutta records that he served in the house of a silk
merchant in Milk Street from 1792 to 1797, that he was
occupied from six or seven in the morning till eight at
night; that there was supper at 8.30, followed by prayers,
and that all went to bed at ten. An apprentice in the
same house said that he never put on his hat for weeks
together, and that more than three years elapsed before
his first holiday was granted. William Cobbett in 1783
got into a lawyer’s office in Gray’s Inn where, he relates,
“I worked like a galley slave from five in the morning
till eight or nine at night, and sometimes all night long.
I never quitted this gloomy recess except on Sundays
when I usually took a walk to St. James’s Park.” Such
instances might be multiplied to any extent; and in
short it comes to this, that the Londoners of last century
lived from year to year <em>in</em> their houses, and had no outdoor
exercise. If they were careless about air, they
were equally careless about light, and, but for the cost of
candles, might have disregarded it altogether. Water
was chiefly brought from wells or conduits, and was
used sparingly; and it is needless to add, there were no
water-closets. Even in well-ordered households, stenches
were dreadful; and where there were slatterns, the condition
of affairs may be faintly imagined. Horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
cesspools lay behind or beneath most of the houses,
evolving pestiferous effluvia. Out of doors, the streets
were scarcely less noisome. Rain was the chief scavenger.
Swift, in his description of a City Shower, sets before us
as graphically as Hogarth, the offices of the rain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down</p>

</div></div>

<p>Nor in estimating the sanitary condition of 18th Century
London is the influence of the dead on the living to
be forgotten. The twenty thousand who died annually
remained to poison the survivors. The city grave-yards
were places of decomposition rather than of interment,
and an odour of corpses pervaded many neighbourhoods.
Mr. Samuel Gale wrote in 1736&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the church-yard of St. Paul, Covent Garden, the burials are
so frequent that the place is not capacious enough to contain
decently the crowds of dead, some of whom are not laid above a
foot under the loose earth. The cemetery is surrounded every way
with close buildings; and an acquaintance of mine, whose apartments
look into the churchyard, hath averred to me that the family
have often rose in the night-time and been forced to burn frankincense
and other perfumes to dissipate and break the contagious
vapour. This is an instance of the danger of infection proceeding
from the corrupt effluvia of dead bodies.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></div>

<p>Church-goers were subjected to cadaverous influences
from the dead in the yard without and from the dead in
the vaults below; and pious thoughts acquired an indescribable
savour of the sepulchre. Many illnesses
originated in church; and families who led wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
lives at home were brought into deadly peril when they
turned out on Sundays to public worship.</p>

<p>It is necessary to enter into these details if we would
know what manner of people the Londoners were who
suffered from smallpox, and what sort of place London
was wherein they suffered. Londoners have been taken
for the standard of 18th century smallpox, in forgetfulness
of the fact that there did not then exist in England
a town of a hundred thousand inhabitants&mdash;perhaps
only two or three of fifty thousand; whilst the rural
population bore a far larger proportion to the urban than
is the case at this day. In so far as the sanitary conditions
of Bristol, Norwich, or York resembled those of
London, the analogy between them held good; but to
convert the London rate of smallpox into the common
rate of England, of Europe, and of the world,
and to use the appalling result as a whip of terror
wherewith to enforce universal inoculation, and afterwards
vaccination, was sheer absurdity, if not something
worse.</p>

<p>Whilst smallpox was always present in London, its
appearance in the country was irregular and usually
epidemic. The Bills of Mortality of towns as large as
Northampton were sometimes clear of smallpox for years.
Sir Gilbert Blane, in his advocacy of Vaccination <em>versus</em>
Inoculation, said, that previous to the practice of inoculation
there were many parts of the country where smallpox
was unknown for periods of twenty, thirty, and even
forty years. Mr. Connah, a surgeon of Seaford, Sussex,
with a population of 700, informed Dr. Haygarth in 1782,
that one person had died of smallpox in Seaford about
eleven years before, and he could not ascertain that any
other death from the disease had occurred subsequently;
and that there was reason to believe that a like immunity
prevailed throughout the smaller towns and villages of
the southern counties. Wherever we inquire, we are
driven to the conclusion that the prevalence and fatality
of smallpox in the 18th century were grossly exaggerated
by quacks and panicmongers. Nor should we forget in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
this connection how Professor Waterhouse, of Boston, an
ardent inoculator, had to write in 1787&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by
smallpox in all the four New England Governments; that is, not
one in a million of people.</p></div>

<p>What we have to say of London smallpox during last
century is, that prevalent as it was, our wonder is that
it was not more prevalent; that the disease was bred in
the circumstances and habits of the citizens; and that if
it were possible to reproduce the same conditions, we
should reproduce the same smallpox. On the contrary,
say our valiant vaccinators, the same conditions might
be reproduced, but if the citizens were universally and
efficiently vaccinated and re-vaccinated, there would be
no smallpox. Thus we are taught that people may eat
and drink as they like, live in darkness, neglect personal
cleanliness, take little exercise, breathe air polluted by
respiration, filth, and putrefaction, and that whatever
disease overtakes them, they will be proof against smallpox.
The promise is deceptive, but it was the promise
of the inoculator, and it is the promise of the vaccinator;
and Dr. Drysdale, describes the practice which warrants
the promise as “the greatest triumph of hygienic science&mdash;I
repeat, by far the greatest triumph of positive
hygienic science ever made.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Some share in the fatality of 18th century smallpox
must be charged to the treatment of the disease. What
was described as the cool regimen was no secret, yet its
practice appears to have been limited to few; whilst
with the multitude, patients were confined to close and
heated rooms, under heavy bed-clothes, plied with hot
drinks, cordials, and alcohol, and kept in foul linen until
killed or cured. Frequently, when symptoms of smallpox
appeared, bleeding, blistering, and purging were energetically
resorted to. If a family of children were affected,
they were commonly stowed away in one bed, and their
skins would stick together with pus and sweat. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
much the same in hospitals and workhouses. “I have
seen above forty children,” says Dr. Buchan, “cooped up
in one apartment, all the while they had this disease,
without any of them being admitted to breathe the fresh
air.” The same course was pursued with other fevers,
and the effluvia of the sick-room was overpowering.
Take this instance from Jenner’s own household. His
nephew, Henry, and a maid-servant, were seized with
typhus, and Jenner wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The stench from the poor girl is so great as to fill the house with
putrid vapour; and I shall remove Henry this morning, by means
of a sedan chair, to an adjacent cottage.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p></div>

<p>Indeed, the cleanliness and ventilation we consider so
salutary were sedulously avoided. Cold air was accounted
specially pernicious, and occasionally when the poor,
afflicted with smallpox, were exposed to the weather,
astonishment was expressed that recovery instead of death
was the issue. It is related in Hutchins’s <cite>History of
Dorset</cite> that Blandford was burnt down in 1731, and
several patients in smallpox were laid under the arches
of the bridge as a place of refuge, and, to the general
surprise, all got well, although many had died in their
beds before the fire. John Birch a London surgeon of
high repute, writing in 1814, sums up the case for us on
this head in saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I consider the natural smallpox a mild disease, and only rendered
malignant by mistakes in nursing, in diet, and in medicine, and by
want of cleanliness, which last is the fomes of hospital fevers, and
all camp and contagious disorders.</p>

<p>It would hardly be too bold to say, that the fatal treatment of
this disease, for two centuries, by warming the chamber, and by
stimulating and heating cordials, was the cause of two-thirds of the
mortality which ensued.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></div>

<p>We now come to an interesting question. If the
reader refers to the list of twelve years of greatest smallpox,
and to the list of twelve years of least smallpox in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
London, it will be observed that the years of least smallpox
predominate in the last quarter of the century, and
this in spite of the diffusion of the disease by Inoculation.
The inoculators when charged with increasing smallpox
appealed to the London Bills of Mortality. “Let us,” they
said, “take the last ninety years of the century, and we
shall find that there died in London of smallpox in the
thirty years&mdash;</p>


<div class="fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="70%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">From</td><td class="tdl">1711 to 1740 inclusive</td><td class="tdr">65,383</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr"></td><td class="tdl">1741 to 1770 <span class="pad2">”</span></td><td class="tdr">63,308</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p class="noindent">Here we see, that the number of deaths was greater in
the first thirty years by 2075 than in the second thirty
years during which Inoculation had acquired some stability,
and greater by 8115 than in the last thirty years,
during which Inoculation was the established practice of
most prudent families.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> We are therefore unjustly accused.
These figures leave no doubt that smallpox is
decreasing, and we claim that the decrease is due to our
practice.”</p>

<p>The decrease was certain, but I cannot allow that it
was due to Inoculation; on the contrary I assume that
the decrease would have been greater but for the culture
of the disease by the inoculators. The fact is extremely
distressing to the more rabid vaccinators, and Dr. Corfield
tries to curse it out of existence as “the falsest of
falsehoods;” but there it abides. It is hard for those
who represent Jenner as the saviour of mankind from
smallpox to have it shown that Londoners, at least, were
in process of salvation before his intervention; but facts,
alas! are cruelly unkind to theorists, sentimentalists, and
quacks of all sorts. In the words of Dr. Farr&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after Inoculation was
introduced. The annual deaths from smallpox from 1760 to 1779
were on an average 2323. In the next twenty years, 1780 to 1799
they declined to 1740. The disease, therefore, began to grow less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fatal before Vaccination was discovered; indicating, together with
the diminution of fevers, the general improvement of health then
taking place.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p></div>

<p>The decrease of smallpox towards the close of the century,
says Dr. Farr, was due to “the general improvement
of health then taking place;” but to what was that
improvement due? No marked improvement had been
effected in the sanitary arrangements of London&mdash;why
then this change for the better? My answer is,
that a great alteration was in progress in the popular
diet.</p>

<p>Dr. George Cheyne, in his famous <cite>Essay of Health and
Long Life</cite>, published in 1724, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no chronical distemper whatsoever more universal, more
obstinate, and more fatal in Britain, than the Scurvy taken in its
general extent.</p></div>

<p>And more than fifty years afterwards, in 1783, we
have Dr. Buchan bearing similar testimony&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The disease most common to this country is the Scurvy. One
finds a dash of it in almost every family, and in some the taint is
very deep.</p></div>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to cite authority for what was
so generally known and confessed; but in this question
of smallpox and its prevention we have to deal with
many who appear to be destitute of any historic sense;
who argue as if what Englishmen are to-day, they always
were; and who contend that as there was more smallpox
in London before Jenner than since Jenner, therefore
Jenner must be the cause of the diminution. It is
necessary to condescend to such feeble folk.</p>

<p>The cause of the general scorbutic habit of the people
was widely recognised by medical men, and Buchan
merely repeated their common opinion in saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disease so general must have a general cause, and there is none
so obvious as the great quantity of animal food devoured by the
natives of this island. As a proof that Scurvy arises from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
cause, we are in possession of no remedy for that disease equal to
the free use of vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p></div>

<p>Cheyne said much the same at the earlier date. He
complained that the upper classes gorged themselves
with animal food, and slaked their thirst with wine,
“which is now [1724] become common as water, and the
better sort scarce ever dilute their food with any other
liquor.” Beer had the place of wine among the middle
and lower orders. In the words of Buchan&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The English labourer lives chiefly on bread, which being accompanied
with other dry, and often salt food, fires his blood and excites
an unquenchable thirst, so that his perpetual cry is for drink.</p></div>

<p>He adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If men will live on dry bread, poor cheese, salt butter, broiled
bacon, and such like parching food, they <em>will</em> find their way to the
alehouse&mdash;the bane of the lower orders, and the source of half the
beggary in the nation.</p></div>

<p>Were we to say that the diet of the English for the
greater part of last century consisted of Bread, Beef, and
Beer, we should not go far wrong. The London bread
was then, as now, poor stuff; “spoiled,” says Buchan, “to
please the eye, artificially whitened, yet what most prefer,
and the poorer sort will eat no other.” Whenever it
could be obtained, beer was the beverage that went with
bread, and was drank by young and old. Salt beef and
mutton, bacon, salt fish, and butchers’ offal completed
the dietary of the multitude. The feeding of the poor in
hard seasons exercised the beneficent severely, for the
baker’s bill often went far to exhaust the working-man’s
earnings.</p>

<p>It was easy to recommend the rich to get rid of their
scurvy by a resort to vegetable food, but to the poor
with their obstinate prejudices, shiftlessness, and ignorance,
such a recommendation was a sort of mockery.
Deliverance, however, came in a form recommended by
pleasantness and economy, namely, in the potato. It is
true the tuber had been known long before, but not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
an article of free and ordinary consumption. Toward
the middle of the century it was discovered that potatoes
could be grown cheaply in large quantities, and supply
and demand developed together. Women and children
especially rejoiced in the new food, whilst the benevolent
exulted in the liberal accession to the poor man’s fare.
It became a point of duty with Lord and Lady Bountiful
to recommend the culture and consumption of potatoes
everywhere; and to see how far the substitution of
potatoes for bread had extended early in the nineteenth
century, we need only refer to the pages of Cobbett, who
denounced the change with unwearied virulence as a degradation
of humanity. Certainly potatoes are inferior
to bread in nutritive value, but in food we have to look
for more than mere nutriment; and the general use of
the potato went far to purify and ameliorate the blood
of the English people.</p>

<p>The appearance of the potato as a cheap constituent of
common fare, was an argument wherewith Jenner endeavoured
to allay apprehensions, that, having stopped
smallpox, there would soon be more mouths than food to
fill them. To Dunning he wrote, 10th February, 1805&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have often urged the following argument when too numerous
a population has been thrown in my teeth, as one of the ill effects
likely to attend vaccination. Who would have thought a century
ago, that providence had in store for us that nutritious and excellent
vegetable, the potato&mdash;that ready made loaf, as it were, which is
prepared in higher perfection in the garden of the cottager than in
the highly manured soil of the man of opulence.</p></div>

<p>And again to Worthington, 25th April, 1810&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What a gift from Heaven was this extraordinary vegetable&mdash;a
ready made loaf; reserved, too, till the hour when population, in
these realms at least, began first to increase; and then coming we
scarcely know how. Away with Malthus and his dreary speculations!
The skies are filled with benevolence, and let population
increase how it may, let us not distrust and suppose that men
will ever pick the bones of each other.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p></div>

<p>Nor was the change in the people’s diet limited to the
introduction of the potato; with it came tea. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
we know that tea was drank in England long ere George
III. was King, but it was in his days that tea came into
popular use. Here again we may refer to Buchan, who
was strongly opposed to the innovation. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is said the inhabitants of Great Britain consume more tea
than all the other nations of Europe together. The higher ranks
use tea as a luxury, while the lower orders make a diet of it. The
lowest woman in England must have her tea, and the children
generally share it with her. The mischiefs occasioned by tea arise
chiefly from its being substituted for solid food, and had I time to
spare, I think it could not be better employed than in writing
against the destructive drug. Its use will induce a total change
in the constitutions of the people of this country. Indeed, it has
gone a great way towards effecting that evil already.</p></div>

<p>What Buchan had not time to do, Cobbett subsequently
did, and some of his most racy patches of vituperation
were applied to tea and tea-drinkers. In Bacon, Bread
and Beer, according to Cobbett, consisted the strength
of the English working-man, whilst tea and potatoes he
held in abomination.</p>

<p>To this partial substitution of potatoes and tea for
salted animal food and malt liquor, we may justly attribute
the reduction of the scorbutic habit of the people,
and that improvement of health which were coincident
with the close of last century and were continued into
the present. What every student of vital statistics has
to remember is, that conditions have to be identical to
yield identical results. The lives of the majority of the
English people last century, and notably so in London,
were hard and sordid to a degree which in these times
is difficult to realise. Their sanitary conditions have been
indicated, and I would now enforce the observation, that
they were ill fed and insufficiently fed; consequently
their diseases were malignant, and smallpox not unfrequently
scarred deeply its scorbutic victims. Wherefore
to run a parallel between the Londoners of the 18th
century and the English of the 19th in the matter of
smallpox, and to ascribe any difference between them to
Jenner’s specific, is to display ignorance that is inexcusable,
or craft unscrupulous.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">JENNER’S EARLIER YEARS.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The competent biographer, it is said, must be an admirer
of his subject, for only so far as he sympathises can he
understand. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner.</i>
But I neither propose to write a Life of Jenner, nor do
I believe it essential to insight to sympathise where
compelled to reprobate. In Jenner’s case we have to
deal with an accident rather than with a vigorous
personification of evil. It was his fate to have a happy
(or unhappy) thought, adapted to the humour and practice
of his time, which was immediately caught up and
carried to world-wide issues. In himself, he was as
ordinary a character as was ever thrust into greatness.
For the mischief of his thought, some of his contemporaries
were as responsible as himself&mdash;some, indeed, more
blameworthy. With Bishop Butler I may ask, “Why
may not whole communities be seized with fits of
insanity, as well as individuals?” and with him aver,
“Nothing else can account for a great part of what we
read in history.” The common mind passes at times
into unwholesome conditions, wherein the words of Paul
are exemplified, “For this cause shall God send them a
strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.”</p>

<p>Edward Jenner, the son of a clergyman, was born at
Berkeley, Gloucestershire, on 17th May, 1749. After
the usual education of a youth of his class, he was
apprenticed to Mr. Ludlow, surgeon and apothecary, of
Sodbury, near Bristol; and on the completion of his
time (1770) was sent to London, where he resided for
two years with Dr. John Hunter, who increased his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
means for scientific inquiry by the reception of pupils,
caring much more for his menagerie at Brompton than
for patients, and utilising his pupils as assistants in his
researches. Captain Cook returned from his first voyage
of discovery in 1771, and his collection of specimens of
natural history was assigned to Hunter for arrangement,
who set Jenner to work upon them; and, it is said, he
did his duty so well that he was offered the appointment
of naturalist in Cook’s next expedition. Jenner was,
however, eager to commence business as country surgeon,
and in 1772, at the age of 23, he returned to his native
vale, legally qualified by his experience at Sodbury, and
his two years with Hunter, to practise at discretion on
the good folk of Berkeley.</p>

<p>It may be said that Jenner’s was a poor sort of training
for a medical man, but it is to be questioned if he lost
much by his ignorance; for a century ago medical knowledge
was largely absurdity, and practice mischief; and
he did best who stood most frequently helpless in the
presence of Nature. Sir Benjamin Brodie relates how
he served when a young man with a general practitioner
near Leicester Square&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His treatment of disease seemed to be very simple. He had in his
shop five large bottles, which were labelled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mistura Salina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mistura
Cathartica</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mistura Astringens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mistura Cinchonæ</i>, and
another, of which I forget the name, but it was some kind of white
emulsion for coughs; and it seemed to me that out of these five
bottles he prescribed for two-thirds of his patients. I do not, however,
set this down to his discredit; for I have observed that while
young members of the medical profession generally deal in a great
variety of remedies, they commonly discard the greater number of
them as they grow older, until at last their treatment of diseases
becomes almost as simple as that of my Æsculapius of Little Newport
Street.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></div>

<p>Hunter’s name is often used as a sort of consecration
of Jenner, but for no obvious reason. Hunter confirmed,
if he did not beget in Jenner a strong liking for natural
history; and when Jenner was settled in the country, he
often availed himself of his services as observer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
collector, writing to him for information about the habits
of the cuckoo, the breeding of toads and frogs, and the
sexes of eels; for cuckoos’ stomachs, crows and magpies’
nests, for bats, hedgehogs, blackbirds, lizards, hares, and
fossils; for a cock salmon, for salmon spawn and fry, for
a large porpoise, “for love or money;” for the arm of a
certain patient when he dies; suggesting horrible experiments
on hedgehogs, bats, and dogs, and describing one
of special atrocity upon an ass. The most serious proposition
in their correspondence was that Jenner should
come to London as a teacher of natural history, but
Hunter threw out the suggestion with hesitation, the
qualification for the appointment being 1000 guineas
down. Jenner had improved, or supposed he had
improved, the preparation of tartar emetic, and Hunter
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jenner</span>,&mdash;I am puffing off your tartar as the tartar of all
tartars, and have given it to several physicians to make a trial of,
but as yet have had no account of their success. Had you not
better let a bookseller have it to sell, as Glass of Oxford did his
magnesia? Let it be called Jenner’s Tartar Emetic, or anybody’s
else you please.</p></div>

<p>Hunter died in 1793, and there is no evidence that
Jenner submitted to his judgment the question of Vaccination,
if even we allow that prior to that date the project
had occurred to Jenner himself. It is certain that he
mentioned to Hunter that country folk believed that to
catch cowpox was to be secure from smallpox, and that
Hunter repeated the fact in his conversation and lectures;
but there is no reference to the matter in Hunter’s
writing and correspondence.</p>

<p>It is the habit of Jenner’s admirers to represent him as
a patient investigator to whom a great thought dawned
in boyhood, which was brought forth in the maturity of
life. In conformity with this legend, it is related that
when an apprentice at Sodbury, a young woman came to
his master’s surgery, and smallpox being mentioned, she
said, “I cannot take that disease, for I have had cowpox;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and her observation was pondered in his heart; whereon
Dr. Baron, his biographer, ecstatically launches forth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Newton had unfolded his doctrine of light and colours before he
was twenty: Bacon wrote his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Temporis Partus Maximus</cite> before
he attained that age: Montesquieu had sketched his <cite>Spirit of
Laws</cite> at an equally early period of life: and Jenner, when he was
still younger, contemplated the possibility of removing from among
the list of human diseases one of the most mortal that ever scourged
our race. The hope of doing this great good never deserted him,
though he met with many discouragements; his notions having
been treated with scorn and ridicule by some, and with indifference
by almost all.</p></div>

<p>Against such a paragraph we may write, Sheer
romance! Jenner was by no means reticent, and that the
prevention of smallpox was for any length of time the
burden of his soul, nowhere appears. The romance came
into being after date in order to make much of little,
and to justify payment in cash and reputation. For,
taking Vaccination at the utmost, it was a slight advance
upon existent knowledge and practice. In the first place,
it was a notorious belief in many dairy districts, that to
contract cowpox was equivalent to smallpox in averting
a subsequent attack of smallpox. In the second place,
inoculation with smallpox was the custom of the time;
and if infection with cowpox prevented smallpox, why
should not inoculation with cowpox do so as effectually
as inoculation with smallpox? The intelligence requisite
to reach a conclusion so obvious was not great, and
therefore it was no cause for surprise that when Jenner’s
claim as originator of Vaccination was brought forward,
his priority should be disputed from several quarters; as
by Benjamin Jesty of Yetminster, who inoculated his
wife and sons with cowpox in 1774; by Nash of Shaftesbury;
Mrs. Rendall, and others. Jenner was not insensible
to the force of these claims, but evaded them under
the plea that there was cowpox <em>and</em> cowpox, and that he
had discovered and defined the right sort.</p>

<p>In parts of Holstein, too, cowpox was regarded as good
against smallpox, and on more than one occasion was
deliberately employed for the purpose. Plett, a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
schoolmaster, near Kiel, inoculated three children with
the disease in 1791, who were afterwards credited with
resisting variolous infection in consequence of their
vaccination.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>How thoroughly the asserted prophylaxy of cowpox
was known, Jenner himself was accustomed to bear
witness. He was a member of two clubs, the Medico-Convivial
which met at Rodborough, and the Convivio-Medical
which met at Alveston; and he used to bring
cowpox so persistently under discussion, that, he said, he
was threatened with expulsion if he did not desist. “We
know,” said the jovial doctors, “that an attack of cowpox
is reputed to prevent smallpox, but we know that it
does not, and that should end the matter.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In pursuance of the tactics that would represent
Vaccination as the outcome of the labour of many years,
we have the following extraordinary narrative from
Baron, Jenner’s biographer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was not till 1780 that Jenner was enabled, after much study
and inquiry, to unravel many of the perplexing obscurities and
contradictions with which the question of cowpox was enveloped,
and which had impressed those who knew the traditions of the
country with the opinion that it defied all accurate and satisfactory
elucidation. In the month of May of the year just mentioned,
1780, he first disclosed his hopes and his fears, respecting the great
object of his pursuit, to his friend Edward Gardner. By this time
<em>Jenner’s mind had caught a glimpse of the reputation which
awaited him</em>, but it was still clouded by doubts and difficulties.
He then seemed to feel that it might, in God’s good providence,
<em>be his lot to stand between the living and the dead, and that
through him a plague might be stayed</em>. On the other side, the
dread of disappointment, and the probability of failing to accomplish
his purpose, restrained that eagerness which otherwise would
have prompted him prematurely to publish the result of his
inquiries, and thereby, probably, by conveying insufficient knowledge,
blight forever his favourite hope.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></div>

<p>Many are the marvellous relations in ancient and
modern history, but in the records of the supernatural
it is questionable if there be anything to match the preceding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Painters depict the runaway apprentice listening
on Highgate Hill to the bells as they pealed, “Turn
again Whittington, twice Lord Mayor of London,” but
they might find a finer subject in the young Gloucestershire
surgeon, aged 31, habited “in blue coat and
yellow buttons, buckskins, well polished jockey boots
with handsome silver spurs, a smart whip with silver
handle, and hair done up in a club under a broad-brimmed
hat,”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> with eye fixed in vision, contemplating
his glorious destiny, through clouds of doubt and difficulty,
full twenty years ahead; standing like another
Aaron, censer in hand, between the living and the dead
until the plague was stayed! Verily, if we do not
see miracles, it is because we do not choose to look for
them.</p>

<p>The chapter of the wonderful is not exhausted; yet
greater things remain. Says Baron, and recollect the
year was 1780 and Jenner aged 31&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jenner was riding with Gardner, on the road between Gloucester
and Bristol, near Newport, when the conversation passed of
which I have made mention. He went over the natural history
of cowpox; stated his opinion as to the origin of this affection from
the heel of the horse; specified the different sorts of disease which
attacked the milkers when they handled infected cows; dwelt
upon the variety which afforded protection against smallpox; and
with deep and anxious emotion mentioned his hope of being able
to propagate that variety from one human being to another, till he
had disseminated the practice all over the globe, to the total
extinction of smallpox&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Which is to say, that in 1780, Jenner, aged 31, had
arrived at the conclusion which he offered to the world
in 1798 at the mature age of 49; and in the meanwhile
allowed mankind to perish from smallpox, he having
their salvation in his hands!</p>

<p>The miraculous conversation, says Baron, was concluded
by Jenner in words to the following effect&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gardner, I have entrusted a most important matter to you,
which I firmly believe will prove of essential benefit to the human
race. I know you, and should not wish what I have stated to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
brought into conversation; for should anything untoward turn up
in my experiments I should be made, particularly by my medical
brethren, the subject of ridicule&mdash;for I am the mark they all
shoot at.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p></div>

<p>Gardner, Jenner’s friend, who played the part of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter
ego</i> in the asseveration of an early date for Vaccination,
was a dealer in wines and spirits. Charity believeth all
things, but even charity would exhibit a sceptical countenance
when what it is a man’s interest to prove and
have placed to his credit, is in itself improbable; which,
if true, might be proved by documents and witnesses;
but which is merely supported by his own word and that
of a friend. Let me repeat, there was never a vestige of
evidence adduced for the revelations of 1780 beyond the
bare assertions of Jenner and Gardner; and further,
that they are radically at variance with the tenor and
dates of Jenner’s first publication&mdash;<cite>The Inquiry</cite> of 1798.</p>

<p>The next date to which we come is 1787, in which
year Jenner is represented as having taken his nephew,
George, into a stable to look at a horse with diseased
heels&mdash;</p>

<p>“There,” said he, pointing to the horse’s heels, “is the
source of smallpox. I have much to say on that subject,
which I hope in due time to give to the world.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Baron gives no authority for this anecdote. It is
probably ante-dated six or seven years.</p>

<p>In 1788 Jenner married Catherine Kingscote. In his
domestic relations, he was devotedly affectionate, even
uxorious; ready to defer any duty and to surrender any
advantage to the pleasures of home.</p>

<p>As the phrase ran, Jenner was a good hand at a “copy of
verses,” and one of these, “Signs of Rain,” commencing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The hollow winds begin to blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">The clouds look black, the glass is low&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">has a place in nearly all poetical collections.</p>

<p>In 1792 Jenner applied to the University of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Andrews for the degree of Doctor of Physic. It cost
£15, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Hunter used to say to speculative pupils, “Don’t <em>think</em>,
but <em>try</em>; be patient, be accurate;” and Jenner, in relation
to cowpox, required the advice; for, by his own account,
he was content to <em>think</em> of cowpox for at least a quarter
of a century, whilst he knew by intuition its true origin,
its magical efficacy, and future triumph without any
<em>trial</em>. His first experiment was made in November,
1789, upon his son Edward, his first-born, an infant of
eighteen months.</p>

<p>“He was inoculated with cowpox?”</p>

<p>O, no!</p>

<p>“Then with grease from a horse’s heel?”</p>

<p>Not at all!</p>

<p>“With what then?”</p>

<p>Why, with swinepox; and it answered!</p>

<p>The child sickened on the eighth day; a few pustules
appeared; they were late and slow in their progress, and
small, but they proved sufficient. The poor child was
then put through what was styled the Variolous Test:
not once or twice, but five or six times at various
intervals, he was inoculated with smallpox without other
obvious effect than local inflammation and erysipelas.
Nothing ever claimed for cowpox turned out more
satisfactorily than this experiment with swinepox&mdash;supposing
we trust Jenner.</p>

<p>Arguing from the records (and we have nothing else
to argue from) it was not until about 1795 that Jenner
turned his attention with serious purpose to cowpox.
This Baron allows, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many years elapsed before Jenner had an opportunity of completing
his projected experiments in Vaccination, and he encountered
numerous difficulties in carrying on the preliminary part of
his inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></div>

<p>But Baron fails to specify what were the projected
experiments, or the difficulties which hindered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
performance. It is a common nuisance in “sympathetic”
biographies to have unlimited drafts made upon one’s
credulity. The evidence of example would go to prove
that Jenner placed his trust in swinepox rather than
cowpox, at least as late as 1789.</p>

<p>In April, 1795, a general inoculation took place at
Berkeley on Dimsdale’s plan; that is to say, all in the
district who had not had smallpox were inoculated with
the disease, so that they might sicken together and do
no mischief. Among the Berkeleyans was one Joseph
Merret, who, 1770, had attended horses with greasy heels
and at the same time milked cows, and from the cows
had contracted cowpox. Jenner inoculated him repeatedly
with smallpox on this occasion, but with no effect;
whence he concluded that the attack of cowpox in 1770
had maintained Merret secure from smallpox for five-and-twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Jenner’s aim was now directed to demonstrate that the
common faith in cowpox as a defence against smallpox
was well-founded; and to do so it was necessary to clear
away two objections&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, That some who had caught cowpox had subsequently
suffered smallpox.</p>

<p>To which he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>Various eruptions occur on the teats of cows, which
are confounded with cowpox, and infect the milkers; and
these, I admit, do not protect from smallpox.</p>

<p>In a letter to Edward Gardner in 1798 he remarked&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <em>true</em> has many imitations by the <em>false</em> on the cow’s udder
and nipples; and all is called <em>cowpox</em> whether on the cow or communicated
to the human.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Second</span>, That some who had contracted true cowpox
had nevertheless fallen victims to smallpox.</p>

<p>To which he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>Admitted: but then the milker had not received infection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
from the cow at the proper time, but at a stage
of the eruption too early or too late.</p>

<p>If the reader will set these points clearly before him,
he will have the measure of Jenner’s claim. It was a
claim to define the truth there was in a popular belief&mdash;not
to make an independent discovery.</p>

<p>Jenner at this juncture had staked his hope on the
identification of horsegrease with cowpox. Yet even in
this identification he does not seem to have been original.</p>

<p>It was a persuasion among the farmers that pox on
the cows was derived from grease on the horse; and
that infection with horsegrease was just as good against
smallpox as infection with its derivative cowpox. The
fact, however, of this derivation of cowpox from horsegrease
was contested, but Jenner was positive. Writing
in 1794 he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At our last meeting our friend treated my discovery of the origin
of cowpox as chimerical. Farther investigation has convinced me
of the truth of my assertion beyond the possibility of a denial.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p></div>

<p>Challenged to produce direct evidence that grease from
the horse produced pox in the cow, he met with considerable
difficulty, so that on 2nd August, 1797, he had
to write&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The simple experiment of applying the matter from the heel of
the horse, in its proper state, to the nipples of the cows, when they
are in a proper state to be infected by it, is not so easily made as
at first sight may be imagined. After waiting with impatience for
months in my own neighbourhood, without effect, I sent a messenger
to Bristol, in vain, to procure the true virus. I even procured
a young horse, kept him constantly in the stable, and fed him with
beans in order to make his heels swell, but to no purpose.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<p>In the matter of horsegrease, it is to be observed as
Dr. Mason Good informs us, “that for ages blacksmiths
and farriers, who had been infected with grease, were
considered as generally insusceptible of variolous contagion.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Wherefore, to Jenner is not to be ascribed
the discovery of horsegrease as good against smallpox;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
but merely that he held with certain farmers that it was
the cause of cowpox, and one in constitution with cowpox;
and thus endeavoured to combine the tradition of the
stable with that of the dairy.</p>

<p>It was not until 1796 that Jenner made any experiment
with cowpox&mdash;up to that date, whatever his visions, he
was in Hunter’s phrase a <em>thinker</em>, not a <em>trier</em>. On 14th
May of that year, he took matter from the hand of Sarah
Nelmes, who had been infected by her master’s cows, and
inserted it by two incisions in the arm of James Phipps,
a child of eight years of age. The boy went through the
disease in a regular manner, and on the 1st July was inoculated
with smallpox without effect, to Jenner’s intense
satisfaction. He communicated the event to Gardner in
the following letter&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, 19th July, 1796.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gardner</span>,&mdash;As I promised to let you know how I proceeded
in my inquiry into the nature of that singular disease the Cowpox,
and being fully satisfied how much you feel interested in its success,
you will be gratified in hearing that I have at length accomplished
what I have been so long waiting for, the passing of the Vaccine
Virus from one human being to another by the ordinary mode of
inoculation.</p>

<p>A boy of the name of Phipps was inoculated in the arm from the
pustule on the hand of a young woman who was infected by her
master’s cows. Having never seen the disease but in its casual
way before, that is when communicated from the cow to the hand
of the milker, I was astonished at the close resemblance of the
pustules, in some of their stages, to the variolous pustules.</p>

<p>But now listen to the most delightful part of my story. The
boy has since been inoculated for the smallpox, which, as I ventured
to predict, produced no effect. I shall now pursue my experiments
with redoubled ardour.</p></div>

<p>But the experiments could <em>not</em> be pursued, for, from
July, 1796 till the spring of 1798, Cowpox disappeared
from the dairies around Berkeley, and, as we have seen,
horsegrease was also unattainable. Jenner had, however,
resolved on publication. Life was advancing; he
had made no mark in the world; and, as he wrote to
Gardner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Added to all my other cares, I am touched hard with the reigning
epidemic&mdash;Impecuniosity.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>At first he proposed to embody his views in a paper
for the Royal Society, but on second thoughts determined
to issue a pamphlet. Having read his manuscript to Dr.
Worthington, Mr. Paytherus, and Mr. H. Hicks, assembled
round the table of Mr. Thomas Westfaling, at Rudhall,
near Ross, Herefordshire, and having secured their approval,
the matter was put to press, and about the end
of June, 1798, appeared&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The curious tradition among the dairy folk of Gloucestershire,
that persons who had suffered from Cowpox were thereby rendered
insusceptible of Smallpox, was made known to Edward Jenner
when a doctor’s apprentice, <em>and was never afterwards absent from
his mind</em>. Thirty years elapsed before the fruit was borne to the
public; <em>but incessantly he thought, and watched, and experimented
on the subject</em>, and the work in which at length he recorded the
incomparable results of his labour may well have commanded the
confidence of reflecting persons.</p>

<p>Little would ever be heard of objections to Vaccination, if all who
undertake the responsibility of its performance, and all who feel
disposed to resist its adoption, <em>would but thoroughly study that
masterpiece of medical induction</em>, and imitate the patience and
caution and modesty with which Jenner laid the foundations of
every statement he advanced.</p>

<p>In the first <cite>Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ
Vaccinæ</cite>, Jenner set on a scientific basis the popular belief to which
I have referred; and the close of the 18th Century, which had
much to darken it, will be remembered till the end of human history
for the greatest physical good ever yet given by science to the
world.&mdash;<cite>Papers relating to the History and Practice of Vaccination.</cite>
Pp. xi. and xii. London, 1857.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">These are the words of Mr. John Simon, and in them
we have the Jennerian legend with the morsel of fact
to the mass of fable which characterises legendary matter,
ancient and modern. The recommendation to “study
thoroughly that master-piece of medical induction,”
Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>, is a mere flourish of panegyric; for,
as Mr. Simon was well aware, the book had been out of
print for half a century, and was practically inaccessible;
whilst its reproduction has usually been considered undesirable
in the interests of Vaccination, inasmuch as it
reveals more than is expedient for common knowledge.
An idol that is good to swear by is always fortified by
a convenient obscurity.</p>

<p>The <cite>Inquiry</cite> is a quarto of less than seventy pages in
large type, set in broad margins in the grand style of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
period, and illustrated with four coloured plates. There
are eight pages of Introductory Matter, followed by
thirty-four pages of Cases, concluding with twenty-six
pages of General Observations.</p>

<p>It is to the Cases as the ground of the argument, that
I would first direct attention. They are twenty-three,
and may be thus assorted&mdash;</p>

<p>13 of Cowpox communicated by accident.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 4 of Horsegrease communicated by accident and inoculated by design.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 6 of Cowpox inoculated by design or transferred from arm-to-arm.</p>

<p>It may be tedious, but I should like to go with the
reader over these Cases, for they are highly instructive.
Let us take the first twelve of Cowpox communicated
by accident.</p>


<p class="p1 center">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Merret</span>, Gardener.</p>

<p>In 1770 attended to Horses, milked Cows, and caught
Cowpox. Afterwards his family had Smallpox, but he
escaped. In 1795 Jenner repeatedly inoculated him with
Smallpox without effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sarah Portlock</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p>In 1771 had Cowpox. In 1792 nursed her child in
Smallpox “conceiving herself secure,” and was at the
same time inoculated with Smallpox in both arms without
effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Phillips</span>, Tradesman.</p>

<p>Had Cowpox when nine years old. Was inoculated
with Smallpox by Jenner at the age of 62 without
effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mary Barge</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p>In 1767 had Cowpox. In 1791 was inoculated with
Smallpox without effect. Had also acted as nurse to
Smallpox patients without catching the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, Gentlewoman.</p>

<p>Had Cowpox when very young, contracted by handling
dairy utensils. Was subsequently exposed to Smallpox,
“where it was scarcely possible for her to have escaped;”
and in 1778 was inoculated with Smallpox by Jenner
without effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this point, I would draw attention to the ages of
the persons set forth in these Cases: they were past
middle life when the susceptibility to Smallpox was either
low or extinct. The reason given by Jenner for their
production was that he “wished to show that the change
produced in the constitution by Cowpox is not affected
by time”&mdash;a claim which vaccinators at this day surrender,
insisting on the necessity of re-vaccination to
maintain “the benign influence;” but apart from that
consideration, there was nothing extraordinary in resistance
to inoculated Smallpox. Without the intervention
of Cowpox, inoculators were constantly meeting patients
who would not “take,” even with repeated attempts,
and especially among elderly people; and some who
obstinately resisted inoculated Smallpox, subsequently
contracted the disease in the ordinary way. So much
Jenner himself allowed, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are many who from some peculiarity in habit resist the
common effects of variolous matter inserted into the skin, and in
consequence are haunted through life with the distressing idea of
being insecure from subsequent infection. (P. 60.)</p></div>

<p>Yet he was pleased to refer this well recognised resistance
to variolation in those who had had Cowpox to
Cowpox, allowing nothing for habit of body!</p>


<p class="p1 center">VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sarah Wynne</span>, Dairymaid.</p>

<p>In 1796 had Cowpox in May, and “in so violent a
degree, that she was confined to her bed, and rendered
incapable for several days of pursuing her ordinary
vocation.” On 28th March, 1797, she was inoculated
with Smallpox by Jenner without effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Under this Case Jenner observes, that “among our
dairy farmers those who have had Smallpox either escape
Cowpox, or are disposed to have it slightly; and as soon
as the complaint shows itself among cattle, assistants are
procured, if possible, who are thus rendered less susceptible
of it, otherwise the business of the farm could
scarcely go forward.” At the farm where Sarah Wynne
was employed, all had had Smallpox except Sarah, and
all save Sarah, escaped.</p>


<p class="p1 center">VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Rodway</span>, Dairyman.</p>

<p>In 1796 had Cowpox. In 1797 was inoculated with
Smallpox by Jenner without effect.</p>

<p>Under Rodway’s Case Jenner showed that the farmers
were at fault in supposing that Smallpox kept off Cowpox.
In the dairy where Rodway was employed, all the
milkers had passed through Smallpox, except Rodway,
and all contracted Cowpox; “but there was no comparison
in the severity of the disease as it was felt by them
and by Rodway. While he was confined to bed, they
were able, without much inconvenience, to follow their
ordinary business.” Thus Jenner argued that though
Smallpox might not keep off Cowpox, it made Cowpox
milder.</p>


<p class="p1 center">VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Wynne</span>, Dairymaid.</p>

<p>In 1759 had Cowpox slightly when 19 years of age.
“As the malady had shown itself in so slight a manner,”
observed Jenner, “and as it had taken place at so distant
a period of her life, I was happy with the opportunity
of trying the effects of variolous matter upon her constitution,
and on the 28th of March, 1797, I inoculated
her” without effect. Nevertheless in the following year,
1798, she again caught Cowpox, having a “large pustulous
sore” accompanied with “general lassitude, shiverings,
alternating with heat, coldness of extremities, and a quick
and irregular pulse.”</p>


<p class="p1 center">IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Smith</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Although [wrote Jenner as preface to this Case] the Cowpox
shields the constitution from the Smallpox, and the Smallpox proves
a protection against its own poison, yet it appears that the human
body is again and again susceptible of the infectious matter of the
Cowpox.</p></div>

<p>In 1780, when attending to Horses with sore heels,
Smith conveyed the equine infection to Cows, “and from
the Cows it was communicated to Smith. In 1791, the
Cowpox broke out at another farm where he then lived
as a servant, and he became affected with it a second
time; and in 1794 he was so unfortunate as to catch it
again. The disease was equally as severe the second and
third time as it was on the first.” He was twice inoculated
with Smallpox in 1795, and exposed to Smallpox
without effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Simon Nichols</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p>In 1782 was employed in dressing the sore heels of
Horses, and at the same time assisted in milking Cows,
thereby infecting them and generating Smallpox. Changing
his situation, he communicated the disease to other
Cows, and was himself severely affected. Some years
afterwards, he was inoculated with Smallpox by Jenner
without effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Stinchcomb</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p>In 1782 had Cowpox severely on the same farm with
Nichols. In 1792 he was inoculated with Smallpox
along with a large party, but in his case without result.
“During the sickening of some of his companions, their
symptoms so strongly recalled to his mind his own state
when sickening with the Cowpox, that he very pertinently
remarked their striking similarity.”</p>


<p class="p1 center">XII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hester Walkley</span>, Farm Servant.</p>

<p>In 1782 had Cowpox when she was attended by Jenner.
In 1795 she, and seven other pauper women of Tortsworth,
who also had had Cowpox, were inoculated with Smallpox
by Henry Jenner without effect. “This state of
security proved a fortunate circumstance,” observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Jenner, “as many of the poor women were at the same
time in a state of pregnancy.” Why then, it might have
been asked, did Henry Jenner try to variolate them?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These Twelve Cases illustrate Jenner’s procedure; and
those familiar with scientific methods, and the scrutiny
and caution requisite to arrive at trustworthy physiological
data, will view with some astonishment his free
and easy induction. In the majority of the Cases he was
without proof that his subjects had suffered Cowpox;
and the absence of this certainty was the more remarkable
as he knew that the dairy-folk described as Cowpox
several varieties of eruption. The same rural observers
who held that Cowpox averted Smallpox, also held that
Smallpox averted Cowpox; and yet Jenner had to show
in Rodway’s Case No. vii., that they were mistaken;
although, granting the thesis that Smallpox and Cowpox
were equivalents and mutually preventive, the rural
faith ought to have stood justified, and Smallpox shown
to be good against Cowpox. Again Jenner allowed that
an attack of Cowpox did not prevent a subsequent attack
of Cowpox, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is singular to observe that the Cowpox virus, although it renders
the constitution insusceptible of the variolous, should nevertheless
leave it unchanged with respect to its own action.</p></div>

<p>Singular indeed! The observation in presence of the
principle to be established was nothing short of imbecile.
If Smallpox prevented Smallpox, and Cowpox was one
with Smallpox, and Cowpox did not avert Cowpox, how
was Cowpox to avert Smallpox? The insusceptibility
of Jenner’s subjects to variolous inoculation was, as
observed, of little account. Resistance to inoculated
Smallpox was of common occurrence, and inoculators
practised various dodges to overcome it. To have made
such experiments approximately conclusive would have
required the inoculation with Smallpox of subjects of
corresponding ages and temperaments who had not passed
through Cowpox; and the probability is that the results
would not have been dissimilar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>We must not, however, proceed farther until Cowpox
is described; and for that purpose I cannot do better
than cite Jenner verbatim.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">JENNER’S DESCRIPTION OF COWPOX.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox appears on the nipples of the Cows in the form of irregular
pustules. At their first appearance they are commonly
a palish blue, or rather of a colour somewhat approaching to livid,
and are surrounded by an inflammation. These pustules, unless
a timely remedy be applied,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> frequently degenerate into phagedenic
[spreading] ulcers, which prove extremely troublesome. The
animals become indisposed, and the secretion of milk is much
lessened.</p>

<p>Inflamed spots now begin to appear on different parts of the
hands of the domestics employed in milking, and sometimes on
the wrists, which run on to suppuration, first assuming the appearance
of the small vesications produced by a burn. Most commonly
they appear about the joints of the fingers, and at their extremities;
but whatever parts are affected, if the situation will admit,
these superficial suppurations put on a circular form, with their
edges more elevated than their centres, and of a colour distantly
approaching to blue. Absorption takes place, and tumours appear
in each axilla [arm-pit].</p>

<p>The system becomes affected, the pulse is quickened; shiverings,
succeeded by heat, general lassitude and pains about the loins and
limbs, with vomiting, come on. The head is painful, and the
patient is now and then even affected with delirium. (P. 3.)</p></div>

<p>And Jenner might have added, with convulsions.</p>

<p>Having drawn this alarming picture of the effects of
Cowpox, he interposes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These symptoms arise principally from the irritation of the sores,
and not from the primary action of the vaccine virus upon the constitution.
(P. 5.)</p></div>

<p>If Cowpox meant all this, some might prefer, at least,
the risk of Smallpox; hence the judicious explanation&mdash;the
irritation of the sores, and not the poison in the
blood, was the cause of the distressing symptoms.
Jenner went on&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These symptoms, varying in their degrees of violence, generally
continue from one day to three or four, leaving ulcerated sores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
about the hands, which, from the sensibility of the parts, are very
troublesome, and commonly heal slowly, frequently becoming
phagedenic, like those from whence they sprang. During the
progress of the disease, the lips, nostrils, eyelids, and other parts
of the body, are sometimes affected with sores; but these evidently
arise [How evidently?] from their being heedlessly rubbed or
scratched with the patient’s infected fingers. (P. 5.)</p></div>

<p>It was this serious disease, this communicated Cowpox,
which the subjects of the foregoing Cases were assumed
to have passed through; and Jenner, in conformity with
the opinion of the dairies, held that they were thereby
rendered proof against Smallpox. Whilst his Twelve
Cases make a show of inquiry, they bear no trace of
extensive or critical research. In the general inoculations
then prevalent, those who had undergone Cowpox
were not treated as protected (as were those who
had had Smallpox) but were “cut” with their neighbours&mdash;as,
in Case xii., were the eight cowpoxed paupers of
Tortworth. Yet Jenner was at no pains to collect and
set forth the evidence of other Gloucestershire practitioners,
who, in the course of duty, must have known as
much of Cowpox as himself, and might have set scores
of Cases alongside his perfunctory dozen.</p>

<p>Having perused Jenner’s description of Cowpox, let
us now turn to his account of its origin.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">GENERATION OF COWPOX IN HORSEGREASE.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a disease to which the Horse, from his state of domestication,
is frequently subject. The Farriers have termed it <span class="smcap">The Grease</span>.
It is an inflammation and swelling in the heel, accompanied in its
commencement with small cracks or fissures, from which issues a
limpid fluid, possessing properties of a peculiar kind. This fluid
seems capable of generating a disease in the human body (after it
has undergone the modification I shall presently speak of) which
bears so strong a resemblance to the Smallpox, that I think it
highly probable it may be the source of that disease.</p>

<p>In this Dairy Country a great number of Cows are kept, and
the office of milking is performed indiscriminately by Men and
Maid Servants. One of the former having been appointed to apply
dressings to the heels of a Horse affected with the malady I have
mentioned, and not paying due attention to cleanliness, incautiously
bears his part in milking the Cows, with some particles of the
infectious matter adhering to his fingers. When this is the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it frequently happens that a disease is communicated to the Cows,
and from the Cows to the Dairy-maids, which spreads through the
farm until most of the cattle and domestics feel its unpleasant consequences.
This disease has obtained the name of <span class="smcap">The Cowpox</span>.</p>

<p>Thus the disease makes its progress from the Horse (as I conceive)
to the nipples of the Cow, and from the Cow to the Human
Subject. (Pp. 2 and 6.)</p></div>

<p>This conception of the origin and progress of the
disease was not Jenner’s specially: he shared it with
the farmers to whom it was a novelty&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rise of Cowpox in this country may not have been of very
remote date, as the practice of milking Cows might formerly have
been in the hands of women only; which I believe is the case now
in some other dairy countries; and consequently that the Cows
might not in former times have been exposed to the contagious
matter brought by the men servants from the heels of Horses.
<em>Indeed a knowledge of the source of infection is new in the minds
of most of the farmers in this neighbourhood</em>, but has at length
produced good consequences; and it seems probable from the precautions
they are disposed to adopt, that the appearance of the
Cowpox here may either be entirely extinguished or become extremely
rare. (P. 56.)</p></div>

<p>Thus Cowpox was to be extinguished by forbidding
milkers to handle Horses’ greasy heels. Jenner himself
tried to produce Cowpox in the manner described, but
without success&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is very easy [he wrote] to procure pus from old sores on the
heels of Horses. This I have often inserted into scratches made
with a lancet on the sound nipples of Cows, and have seen no other
effects from it than simple inflammation. (P. 45.)</p></div>

<p>What was requisite for success, he concluded, was the
limpid fluid from the Horse’s heel at an early stage of
the disease, and that it should be applied to the Cow’s
nipples at a certain season&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The virus from the Horses’ heels is most active at the commencement
of the disease, even before it has acquired a pus-like
appearance; indeed I am not confident whether this property in
the matter does not entirely cease as soon as it is secreted in the
form of pus. I am induced to think it does cease, and that it is
the thin darkish-looking fluid only, oozing from the newly formed
cracks in the heels, similar to what sometimes appears from erysipelatous
blisters, which gives the disease. Nor am I certain that
the nipples of the Cows are at all times in a state to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
infection. The appearance of the disease in the spring and the
early part of the summer, when they are disposed to be affected
with spontaneous eruptions so much more frequently than at other
seasons, induces me to think, that the virus from the Horse must
be received upon them when they are in this state in order to produce
effects. Experiments, however, must determine these points.
(P. 45.)</p></div>

<p>Whilst thus explicit as to what was requisite for the
infection of the Cow by the Horse, Jenner did not succeed
in producing Cowpox from Horsegrease. He had
to write&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The spring of the year 1797, which I intended particularly to
have devoted to the completion of this investigation, proved from
its dryness remarkably adverse to my wishes. No Cowpox appeared
in the neighbourhood; for it most frequently happens that while
the farmers’ Horses are exposed to the cold rains of spring their
heels become diseased. (P. 44.)</p></div>

<p>Yet without proof, he argued as if he had proof, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With respect to the opinion adduced, that the source of the infection
is a peculiar morbid matter arising in the Horse, although
I have not been able to prove it from actual experiments conducted
immediately under my own eye, yet the evidence I have adduced
appears sufficient to establish it. (P. 43.)</p></div>

<p>Evidence adduced! Of evidence there was none.
The farmers might be right in their opinion that Cowpox
sprang from Horsegrease, but opinion was not
evidence, nor even such assurance as this of Jenner’s&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I feel no room for hesitation respecting the common origin of
the disease, being well convinced that it never appears among the
Cows unless they have been milked by some who at the same time
has the care of a Horse affected with diseased heels. (P. 44.)</p></div>

<p>But not even to this conviction did he adhere. “It
was highly probable,” he thought, “that not only the
heels of the Horse, but other parts of the body of that
animal, are capable of generating the virus which produces
the Cowpox”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An extensive inflammation of the erysipelatous kind appeared
without any apparent cause upon the upper part of the thigh of a
sucking Colt, the property of Mr. Millet, a farmer at Rockhampton,
the inflammation continued several weeks, and at length terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the formation of three or four small abscesses. The inflamed
parts were fomented, and dressings were applied by some of the
same persons who were employed in milking the Cows. The
number of Cows milked was 24, and the whole of them had the
Cowpox. The milkers, consisting of the farmer’s wife, a man and
a maid-servant, were infected by the Cows. The man servant had
previously gone through the Smallpox, and felt but little of the
Cowpox. The servant maid had some years before been infected
with the Cowpox; and she also felt it now in a slight degree. But
the farmer’s wife, who had never gone through either Smallpox or
Cowpox felt its effects very severely.</p>

<p>That the disease produced upon the Cows by the Colt, and from
thence conveyed to those who milked them, was the <em>True</em> and not
the <em>Spurious</em> Cowpox, there can be scarcely any room for suspicion;
yet it would have been more completely satisfactory had the effects
of variolous matter [Inoculation with Smallpox] been ascertained
on the farmer’s wife; but there was a peculiarity in her situation
which prevented my making the experiment. (P. 62.)</p></div>

<p>Spurious Cowpox! What was Spurious Cowpox?
Here is Jenner’s answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pustulous sores frequently appear spontaneously on the nipples
of the Cows, and instances have occurred, though very rarely, of
the hands of the servants employed in milking being affected with
sores in consequence, and even of their feeling an indisposition from
absorption. These pustules are of a much milder nature than those
which arise from that contagion which constitutes the True Cowpox.
They are always free from the bluish or livid tint so conspicuous in
the pustules of that disease. <em>No erysipelas attends them</em>, nor do
they show any phagedenic disposition, as in the other case, but
quickly terminate in a scab without creating any apparent disorder
in the Cow. This complaint appears at various seasons of the year,
but most commonly in the spring, when the Cows are first taken
from their winter food and fed with grass. It is very apt to appear
also when they are suckling their young. But <em>this disease is not
to be considered as similar in any respect to that of which I am
treating</em>, as it is incapable of producing any specific effects upon
the Human Constitution. However, it is of the greatest consequence
to point it out here, lest the want of discrimination should occasion
an idea of security from the infection of the Smallpox, which might
prove delusive. (Pp. 7 and 8.)</p></div>

<p>Nothing could be more explicit. <span class="smcap">Cowpox</span> was of two
kinds&mdash;True and Spurious. The Spurious consisted of
pustular sores which appeared spontaneously on the
nipples of Cows, and was of no avail against Smallpox:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the True Cowpox, on the other hand, was not a disease
of the Cow, but of the Horse transmitted to the Cow.</p>

<p>It is of prime importance to bear this distinction in
mind; for if it is not borne in mind, much that remains
to be told must appear confused or unintelligible. As
we have seen, it was the belief of the dairymaids that if
they caught Cowpox they would never afterwards catch
Smallpox. Medical men in practice in Gloucestershire
ridiculed the dairymaids’ belief. They said&mdash;</p>

<p>“We know that such is the dairymaids’ faith, but
it is mistaken; for we know dairymaids who have had
Cowpox and afterwards had Smallpox in spite of their
Cowpox.”</p>

<p>At this point Jenner intervened, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let us distinguish. Eruptions contracted in milking
are indiscriminately described as Cowpox by dairy-folk;
but there is an eruption attended with erysipelas and
fever which has all the virtue they claim for it. This
variety of eruption does not originate on the Cow, but is
communicated to the Cow from the Horse. Thus the
dairymaids are right and they are wrong. They are
right when the pox they catch is derived from the Horse
through the Cow: they are wrong when the pox they
catch originates on the Cow without the Horse. In short
Cowpox proper is of no avail against Smallpox. It is
Horsegrease Cowpox that is of sovereign and infallible
virtue. Any maid who receives <span class="smcap">Horsegrease Cowpox</span>
into her veins is, as she believes, for ever after secure
from the infection of Smallpox.”</p>

<p>Let us therefore bear in mind that Jenner’s prescription
was not Cowpox but <span class="smcap">Horsegrease Cowpox</span>. It is
a point to be insisted upon; for, as we shall see, it was
lost from sight, and kept out of sight, to the utter confusion
of the question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to Jenner’s Cases of Horsegrease&mdash;for
not only were farm-folk reputed secure from Smallpox
by reason of Cowpox, but farriers likewise in consequence
of infection with Horsegrease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">XIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Pearce</span>, son of a Farrier.</p>

<p>In consequence of dressing Horses with sore heels at
his father’s when a lad, had sores on his fingers which
suppurated, and occasioned pretty severe indisposition.
Six years afterwards, Jenner inoculated him repeatedly
with Smallpox, but only produced slight inflammation,
and exposed him to the contagion of Smallpox without
effect.</p>

<p>On this Case Jenner observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a remarkable fact, and well-known to many, that we are
frequently foiled in our endeavours to communicate Smallpox by
inoculation to blacksmiths, who in the country are farriers. They
often, as in the above instance, either resist the contagion entirely,
or have the disease anomalously. Shall we not be able now to
account for this on a rational principle?</p></div>


<p class="p1 center">XIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">James Cole</span>, Farmer.</p>

<p>Was infected with Horsegrease in the same way as
Pearce. Some years afterwards was inoculated with
Smallpox, but only a few eruptions appeared on his
forehead, which passed away without maturation.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Abraham Riddiford</span>, Farmer.</p>

<p>Was affected with very painful sores in both hands,
tumours in each arm-pit, and severe and general indisposition,
in consequence of dressing a Mare that had
sore heels. He was attended by a surgeon, who recognising
a similarity of the sores upon his hands with those
of Cowpox, and knowing the effect of Cowpox on the
human constitution, assured him that he never need fear
Smallpox; but, twenty years afterwards, he caught the
disease, which ran its regular course.</p>

<p>From these Cases Jenner drew this conclusion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although the absorption of matter from sores on the heels of
Horses, secures, or nearly secures, the system from variolous infection,
yet it is possible that this cannot be entirely relied upon,
until a disease has been generated by morbid matter from the Horse
on the nipple of the Cow, and passed through that medium to the
human subject.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Which conclusion he repeated thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The active quality of the virus from the Horse’s heels is greatly
increased after it has acted on the nipples of the Cow; as it rarely
happens that the Horse affects his dresser with sores; and as rarely
that a milkmaid escapes infection when she milks infected Cows.
(P. 45.)</p></div>

<p>From this conclusion, Jenner at a subsequent period
withdrew. The virus from the Horse was employed for
inoculation without transmission through the Cow, and
with results equally satisfactory. As we shall find,
Jenner used and distributed Equine Virus neat, which
he certified as “the true and genuine life-preserving
fluid.”</p>

<p>So far the Cases set forth described no more than
ordinary Gloucestershire experience; but we now come
upon ground regarded as peculiarly Jennerian.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sarah Nelmes</span>, Dairymaid.</p>

<p>In 1796 was infected with Cowpox, receiving the virus
on a part of her hand scratched by a thorn. From the
large pustulous sore on Sarah’s hand Jenner, on the 14th
May, inoculated&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1 center">XVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">James Phipps</span>, eight years old.</p>

<p>Said Jenner, “The more accurately to observe the progress
of the infection, I selected a healthy boy, about
eight years old, for the purpose of <span class="smcap">Inoculation for the
Cowpox</span>.” The matter was inserted into his arm by two
incisions, barely penetrating the cutis, each about half
an inch long. The inoculation “took,” and was followed
by a chill, loss of appetite, headache, and restless sleep.
On the 1st of July, the poor lad was inoculated with
Smallpox, and again several months afterwards, it is said,
without effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here [wrote Jenner] my researches were interrupted till the
spring of the year 1798, when, from the wetness of the early part
of the season, many of the farmers’ Horses were affected with sore
heels, in consequence of which Cowpox broke out among several of
our dairies, which afforded me an opportunity of making further
observations upon the curious disease.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>About the latter end of February, 1798, William
Haynes and Thomas Virgoe, having to wash a Mare with
sore heels, were infected with Grease, and described their
sensations as much the same as when they were inoculated
with Smallpox. Their infection proved that if Grease
was good against Smallpox, Smallpox was not good
against Grease. Haynes was employed as a milker,
and Pox broke out among his master’s Cows about ten
days after he had first assisted in washing the Mare’s
heels.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Baker</span>, five years old.</p>

<p>Inoculated, 16th March, 1798, with matter taken from
a pustule on the hand of the aforesaid Thomas Virgoe
poisoned with Grease from the Mare’s heels. “He became
ill on the sixth day with symptoms similar to those excited
by Cowpox, and on the eighth was free from indisposition.”</p>

<p>On this case of Horsegrease inoculation, Jenner observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have seen that the virus from the Horse is not to be relied
upon as rendering the system secure from variolous infection, but
that the matter produced by it on the nipple of the Cow is perfectly
so. Whether the virus passing from the Horse through the human
constitution, as in the present instance, will produce a similar effect
remains to be decided. This would have been effected, but the boy
was rendered unfit for Smallpox Inoculation from having felt the
effects of a contagious fever in a work-house soon after this experiment
was made.</p></div>

<p>Mark the assumption, “<em>The virus from the Horse is
not to be relied upon as rendering the system secure from
variolous infection, but the matter produced by it on the
nipples of the Cow is perfectly so!</em>” Such was Jenner’s
method of induction! How could he leave the question
undecided? Why not have waited until little Baker recovered
from his fever? or why not have inoculated
another work-house child with Horsegrease? The true
sons of science do not rush into print in such shameless
deshabille.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">XIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Summers</span>, aged five and a half.</p>

<p>Inoculated 16th March, 1798, from the nipple of one
of the Cows infected with Horsegrease by Haynes.
Subsequently inoculated with Smallpox without effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Pead</span>, aged eight.</p>

<p>Inoculated, 28th March, from Summers. Subsequently
inoculated with Smallpox without effect.</p>


<p class="p1 center">XXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hannah Excell</span>, aged seven.</p>

<p>And several children and adults were inoculated from
the arm of Pead on 5th April. “The greater part of
them sickened on the sixth day, and were well on the
seventh; but in three of the number a secondary indisposition
arose in consequence of an extensive erysipelatous
inflammation which appeared on the inoculated
arms. By the application of mercurial ointment to the
inflamed parts (a treatment recommended under similar
circumstances in the inoculated Smallpox) the complaint
subsided without giving much trouble.”</p>

<p>Excell was inoculated in three places on her arm.
“This,” said Jenner, “was not done intentionally, but
from the accidental touch of the lancet, <em>one puncture
being always sufficient</em>.” The resulting pustules so much
resembled those arising from inoculation with Smallpox,
“that an experienced inoculator would scarcely have discovered
a shade of difference.”</p>

<p>R. F. Jenner did not “take.” The arms of the others
inflamed, and Jenner fearing erysipelas, as in the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
cases, applied a caustic of soap and quick-lime to
Marklove and James, “which,” he says, “effectually answered
my intention in preventing erysipelas.” The
disease was suffered to take its course in Pead, and no
erysipelas appeared.</p>

<p>Inoculated from Mary Pead, and successfully. Was

<p>“These experiments,” said Jenner, “afforded me much
satisfaction; they proved that the matter in passing from
one human subject to another, through five gradations,
lost none of its original properties, John Barge being the
fifth who received the infection successively from Wm.
Summers, the boy to whom it was communicated from
the Cow.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are Jenner’s Cases. In them we have his
“Masterpiece of Medical Induction”&mdash;the fruit of thirty
years of incessant thought, of watching, and of experiment!
Let us carefully observe the dates. Until 1796,
when he operated on Phipps, he never made an experiment
in Horsegrease Cowpox Inoculation; and not until
the middle of March, 1798, a few weeks before going to
press with the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, did he repeat the experiment;
and though his later cases were complicated with erysipelas,
he did not stay to dispose of the difficulty and
alarm thereby excited. He got together his scratch lot
of Cases, as if under some over-mastering compulsion,
and consigned the concern, crude and incomplete, to the
public. By-and-by the hasty performance came to be
spoken of as the result of thirty years of incessant
thought, of patient research, and of unwearied labour.
It is unnecessary to argue the matter. Whilst there is
nothing too great for the credulity of those who are in
the disposition of belief, yet facts are facts, and there is
the stone-wall of the <cite>Inquiry</cite> with its authentic details
whereon to crack the skulls of romancers. In Jenner’s
story as recited to the vulgar, we have the advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
witnessing the development of myth in the light of our
own age under our own eyes.</p>

<p>Taking Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> at the utmost, What was
it? A suggestion to substitute Horsegrease Cowpox for
Smallpox in inoculation. That was all. Beyond this
there was no point of novelty. Some have credited
Jenner with originating the transfer of virus from arm
to arm; but in this respect he followed the example of
many variolators. There was a mild form of Smallpox
occasionally prevalent in London called “pearly pox,” and
Dr. Adams and others kept it going from patient to
patient; and the virus from the body of a healthy variolated
child was in constant request by timid folk, who
fancied the virulence of the original infection might
thereby be abated in transmission.</p>

<p>So much for Jenner’s data. Now for a word or two
as to the speculation that invested his prescription.</p>

<p>He considered that some of the diseases which afflict
men are derived from their domestication of animals, and
that thus several diseases might have a common origin.
“For example,” he asked, “Is it difficult to imagine that
measles, scarlet fever, and ulcerous sore throat with a
spotted skin, have all sprung from the same source?”</p>

<p>About the imagination, there might be little difficulty:
the difficulty lay in the production of proof that any
disease in man was derived from disease in animals, and
that disease so derived was variously manifested. Jenner
wished to have it believed that a variety of Cowpox
was generated from Horsegrease, which Cowpox was the
source of Smallpox. He adduced no evidence, however,
to connect outbreaks of Smallpox with Cowpox; nor did
he ever suggest that dairymaids caught Smallpox from
Cows, or farriers from Horses. His identification of
Horsegrease Cowpox with Smallpox was the resemblance
of their pustules, and on the ground of this resemblance
he affirmed the equivalence of the diseases. Thus in
describing his first inoculation of Cowpox, that of Phipps
from the hand of Sarah Nelmes on the 14th of May,
1796, he wrote&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The appearance of the incisions in their progress to a state of
maturation was much the same as when produced in a similar
manner by variolous matter. This appearance was in a great
measure new to me, and I ever shall recollect the pleasing sensations
it excited; as, from its similarity to the pustule produced by
variolous inoculation, it incontestably pointed out the close connection
between the two diseases, and almost anticipated the
result of my future experiments. (P. 30.)</p></div>

<p>The similarity of the Cowpox and Smallpox pustules
<em>incontestably pointed out</em> the close connection between
the two diseases! The observation and the conclusion
are worth notice, being characteristic of Jenner’s loose
and illogical mind. He was familiar with Tartar Emetic,
and he might have observed that it produced pustules on
the skin exactly like those of Cowpox and Smallpox;
wherefore would it have been fair to argue that the
pustules being alike, their causes were incontestably
identical? Dr. Hamernik of Prague observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some years ago the theory was brought forward, under the
auspices of the great alchemistical artist, Hufeland, that Vaccination
from Tartar Emetic pustules was a perfect substitute for
Vaccination with Cowpox, and had the same beneficent effect.
With this I fully agree; and I remark further, that if Tartar
Emetic pustulation is produced in Cows and Calves, and vaccine
matter is then taken from them, such Vaccination is also perfectly
harmless. The most convincing proof of the beneficent and
identical action of such Vaccination with that of Cowpox, is furnished
by the fact that it presents pustules similar in size and
form, therefore, necessarily of identical value.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p></div>

<p>Having identified Horsegrease Cowpox with Smallpox,
by reason of similarity of pustules, he went on to assert
that such Horsegrease Cowpox was equivalent to Smallpox
for inoculation, and was attended with the like
prophylaxy, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What renders the Cowpox virus so extremely singular is, that
the person affected with it is forever after secure from the infection
of the Smallpox; neither exposure to the variolous effluvia, nor the
insertion of the matter into the skin producing this distemper. (P. 7.)</p>

<p>It is curious also to observe, that the virus, which, with respect
to its effects, is undetermined and uncertain previously to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
passing from the Horse through the medium of the Cow, should
then not only become more active, but should invariably and completely
possess those specific properties which induce in the human
constitution symptoms similar to those of the variolous fever, and
effect in it that peculiar change <em>which for ever</em> renders it insusceptible
of the variolous contagion. (P. 48.)</p></div>

<p>And so on. The assurance was absolute, and the
warrant for the assurance was the Cases adduced, and
the similarity of Horsegrease Cowpox pustules and Cowpox
pustules! But if the pustules were similar, the
effects were not similar. Inoculation with Smallpox
produced Smallpox, mild or otherwise, with pustules few
or many; but inoculation with Horsegrease Cowpox
was attended with no eruption beyond the points of
incision&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is an excess in the number of pustules which we chiefly dread
in the Smallpox; but in the Cowpox no pustules appear, nor does
it seem possible for the contagious matter to produce the disease
from effluvia; so that a single individual in a family might at any
time receive it without the risk of infecting the rest, or of spreading
a distemper that fills a country with terror. (P. 58.)</p></div>

<p>Very good; but where are we? If similarity of
pustule proved the identity of Smallpox and Horsegrease
Cowpox, what did those graver dissimilarities between
the diseases prove? That an objection so obvious should
never have occurred to Jenner indicates the extent of his
logical capacity.</p>

<p>Jenner’s expectation from the issue of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>
had nothing of the prophetic character described by his
enthusiastic biographers. It is only necessary to peruse
its pages and note the dates in order to perceive the impossibility
of the vision of 1780 described by Baron when
Jenner exhibited to Gardner his future glory, and how
he was destined to stand like Aaron between the living
and the dead until the plague was stayed. Alas! how
many similar fables may we entertain because the means
of detection are not, as in Jenner’s case, available.</p>

<p>When Jenner was writing, the English people were
committed to Smallpox Inoculation, or more accurately
Smallpox culture, and it was in competition with Smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that he advanced Cowpox. “If asked,” he said,
“whether his investigation be matter of mere curiosity,
or whether it tend to any beneficial purpose,” he replied
by setting forth the draw-backs to the existing practice,
and contrasting them with the advantages of his own.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding [he wrote] the happy effects of Inoculation,
with all the improvements the practice has received since its first
introduction into this country, it not very unfrequently produces
deformity of the skin, and sometimes, under the best management,
proves fatal. (P. 57.)</p></div>

<p>On the contrary, he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have never known fatal effects arise from the Cowpox, even
when impressed in the most unfavourable manner, producing extensive
inflammations and suppurations on the hands; and as it
clearly appears that this disease leaves the constitution in a state
of perfect security from the infection of the Smallpox, may we not
infer that a mode of Inoculation may be introduced preferable to
that at present adopted, especially among those families, which,
from previous circumstances, we may judge to be predisposed to
have the disease unfavourably?</p></div>

<p>Inoculation was freely charged with exciting scrofula;
thus Jenner observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In constitutions predisposed to scrofula, how frequently we see
the inoculated Smallpox rouse into activity that distressful malady;
and the issue does not seem to depend on the manner of the inoculation,
for it as often occurs in those who receive it mildly as in
those who receive it severely. (P. 60.)</p></div>

<p>Happily he had the grace to refrain from the explicit
assertion that Cowpox was exempt from similar hazard;
yet with characteristic inconsistency, was disposed to
advance a claim for it as an expulsive irritant&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As we have seen [though he never showed] that the constitution
may at any time be made to feel the febrile attack of Cowpox,
might it not, in many chronic diseases, be introduced into the
system, with the probability of affording relief, upon well-known
physiological principles? (P. 60.)</p></div>

<p>A reader of the <cite>Inquiry</cite> in 1798 could never have
supposed that it was an attempt to displace the existing
practice of Inoculation. Nor is there any sign that Jenner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at the time contemplated such an issue. He referred
to Variolous Inoculation with respect, and was satisfied
to suggest that in certain cases inoculation with Horsegrease
Cowpox might be substituted with advantage.
As to the permanent existence of Horsegrease Cowpox
he was doubtful. Since, he said, the farmers had traced
the infection to the Horse, “the appearance of the Cowpox
may either be entirely extinguished or become extremely
rare.” It may be replied that this behaviour on
the part of Jenner was due to reserve and tact, but the
reserve and tact are invisible. The <cite>Inquiry</cite> was simply
what it appears&mdash;a hasty performance, which, in other
hands, developed to more, far more, than its author contemplated.
Subsequently he, and his friends for him,
laid claim to years of research under the influence of
supernatural foresight; but, with the <cite>Inquiry</cite> before us,
I ask where is the evidence? I take the date, 14th May,
1796, when Jenner inoculated Phipps from the hand of
Sarah Nelmes, as the time when the project of inoculation
with Horsegrease Cowpox began to assume form, and
I maintain that the character, order and dates of the
Cases set forth in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> plainly show that they
were got together to sustain the conclusion then arrived
at. When Mr. John Simon descants on Jenner’s thirty
years of incessant thought, watching and experimenting
which resulted in the production of that Masterpiece of
Medical Induction&mdash;<cite>The Inquiry</cite>, the answer is, Peruse
the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, and then say where the fruit of thirty years
of labour is to be found. The assertion is too absurd for
discussion, whatever it may be as an article of faith.</p>

<p>The single point of originality in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> was the
definition of the disease for which prophylactic efficacy
was asserted. The dairymaids said Cowpox: the farriers
said Horsegrease. Jenner said neither Cowpox nor
Horsegrease, but their combination in Horsegrease Cowpox,
which variety of Pox alone ensured life-long security
from Smallpox. We shall see as we proceed how this
position was surrendered and resumed, modified and confused
beyond recognition. Let it suffice at present to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
say that the note of Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> was <span class="smcap">Horsegrease
Cowpox</span> and nothing else. Strike out <span class="smcap">Horsegrease
Cowpox</span>, and the affair is reduced to nonentity.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">THE VARIOLOUS TEST.</h4>

<p>What was called the Variolous Test worked wonderfully
for Jenner; and as we shall have to refer to it
repeatedly, it may be well to describe and dispose of it
at once.</p>

<p>We have seen how the Test was practised in the Cases
in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>. Those who had undergone Cowpox
were inoculated with Smallpox, and as the Smallpox did
not “take,” they were assumed to be proof against that
disease. Hence the absolute conclusion proclaimed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbi
et Orbi</i>, that none inoculated with Cowpox could ever
afterwards contract Smallpox.</p>

<p>It was replied, that some who <em>had</em> suffered from Cowpox
<em>had</em> contracted Smallpox, and that others <em>had</em>
received the disease by inoculation; to which Jenner’s
summary answer was, “There must have been some mistake
about the Cowpox; for no one <em>can</em> have genuine
Cowpox and subsequently incur Smallpox, either by
infection or inoculation.”</p>

<p>Cowpox was inoculated and propagated from arm to
arm; and, in proof that the constitution was fortified
against Smallpox, it was common to inoculate with
Smallpox, which usually did not “take”; whereon the
operator exclaimed, “Behold! the patient is insusceptible
of Smallpox <em>for ever</em>!”</p>

<p>Such was the Variolous Test. It was to multitudes
absolutely conclusive; and to question its validity was
to exhibit a contentious and unphilosophic disposition.</p>

<p>What shall we now say concerning it?</p>

<p>First, that failures were numerous in Variolous Inoculation
apart from Vaccination, and that it was not supposed
that when a patient did not “take,” he was therefore
insusceptible of Smallpox; nor even when he did
“take,” that he was thereby rendered proof against
Smallpox. So many of the successfully inoculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'did subequently fall'">did subsequently fall</ins> victims to Smallpox, that Variolators
at the end of last century were compelled to argue (like
Vaccinators at the end of this) that Variolation was a
guard, but not an absolute guard; and that when it did
not altogether avert Smallpox, it modified and mitigated
an attack. The excuse for failure was as artful as the
motive was urgent: Variolation was too good a trade to
be imperilled for lack of a little ingenuity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if we make full allowance on the score
of frequent incapacity to receive Variolation, we have
yet to explain, on a candid view of the whole evidence,
how it was that in numerous cases Inoculation with
Smallpox was ineffective after Inoculation with Cowpox.</p>

<p>“What can you urge against the Variolous Test?”
was a frequent and imperious demand.</p>

<p>The explanation in general lay in the fact, that Variolation
was attempted before the complete subsidence of
the vaccine fever. The inoculation with Cowpox had
set up a serious constitutional disturbance, and during
that disturbance the Smallpox virus could not develop
its malign energy. Let me show what I mean from the
testimony of Jenner himself.</p>

<p>On 15th March, 1800, the Duke of York requested
Jenner to proceed to Colchester to the 85th Regiment.
Jenner was unable to go, and sent his nephew, George,
instead, who had to report a complete failure. The reason
of the failure was, that the entire Regiment, with women
and children, had the itch! Jenner was then driven to
the conclusion which, says Baron, “he adopted and invariably
maintained to the last hour of his life, namely,
that any cutaneous disease, however slight in appearance,
was capable of interfering with the regular course of the
Cowpox and of preventing it from exercising its full protecting
influence.”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Just so: and mark how the same logic applies to the
Variolous Test, which “nobody could get over.” If any
cutaneous disorder, however slight, could nullify Cowpox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was it not equally probable that the cutaneous disorder
induced by inoculated Cowpox would nullify inoculated
Smallpox <em>until the effects of the Cowpox had
time to subside</em>? When the itch at Colchester was cured,
then inoculation with Cowpox was found to be practicable.
Thus worthless was the Variolous Test on Jenner’s
own principle; yet with such evidence under his eyes
and among his fingers, he failed to discern its significance.
Nor apparently did he inquire whether the influence of
Cowpox was perpetuated over specified periods of six
months, nine months, one year, two years, and so on.
As trader and adventurer, it suited him better to be not
over inquisitive, and to avow boldly that his specific conferred
life-long immunity from Smallpox.</p>

<p>Vaccinators at this day rarely refer to the once famous
Variolous Test: to do so would be absurd. The fact of
Re-Vaccination, of Vaccination after Vaccination at short
intervals, proves, that whatever the influence of the
operation, it is transient and not permanent; and the
cases of Smallpox after Vaccination, and of Smallpox in
its most malignant forms after Re-Vaccination, as if induced
thereby, leave the Variolous Test, which so widely
impressed and imposed upon our forefathers, an exploded
piece of jugglery.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">JENNER IN 1798.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Jenner, with his wife and daughter, left Berkeley for
London on 24th April, 1798, in order to see the <cite>Inquiry</cite>
through the press. He remained in London until 14th
July, and failed, if he tried, to induce any inoculator to
substitute cowpox for smallpox. In the Jenner legend,
it is usual to find some touching remarks on this trip to
town: genius unrecognised: truth turned from every
door: the great soul abiding in patience and courage invincible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Dates, however, are again merciless. The
<cite>Inquiry</cite> was not in the booksellers’ hands until the end
of June, and, within a fortnight after publication, Jenner
was on his way to Berkeley. There was no occasion for
the virtues specified.</p>

<p>Among Jenner’s acquaintance was Henry Cline,
teacher of surgery in St. Thomas’s Hospital; and with
Cline he left some virus in a quill that he had taken
from the arm of Hannah Excell, at Berkeley on 5th April.
Cline had a patient, a child named Richard Weller, with
an affection of the hip-joint, and intending to create an
issue by way of counter-irritation, he inoculated the hip
with Excell’s virus, and thus described the experiment in
a letter to Jenner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lincoln’s Inn Fields</span>, <em>2nd August, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>The Cowpox experiment has succeeded admirably. The child
sickened on the seventh day; and the fever, which was moderate,
subsided on the eleventh day. The inflammation extended to
about four inches diameter, and then gradually subsided without
having been attended with pain or other inconvenience. The ulcer
was not large enough to contain a pea; therefore, I have not converted
it into an issue as I intended. I have since inoculated him
with smallpox in three places, which were slightly inflamed on the
third day, and then subsided.</p>

<p>Dr. Lister, who was formerly physician to the Smallpox Hospital,
attended the child with me, and he is convinced that it is not possible
to give him the smallpox.</p>

<p>I think the substituting of cowpox poison for the smallpox promises
to be one of the greatest improvements that has ever been
made in medicine; for it is not only so safe in itself, but also does
not endanger others by contagion, in which way the smallpox has
done infinite mischief. The more I think on the subject, the more
I am impressed with its importance.</p></div>

<p>Cline then attempted to vaccinate with virus taken
from Weller’s hip, but failed. He wrote to Jenner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lincoln’s Inn Fields</span>, <em>18th August, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>Seven days since I inoculated three children with cowpox matter,
and I have the mortification of finding that the infection has not
taken, and I fear I shall be entirely disappointed unless you can
contrive to send me some fresh matter. I think it might come in
a quill in a letter, or enclosed in a bit of tin-foil.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Jenner was unable to comply with Cline’s request: he
had no cowpox to transmit: and readers of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>
who addressed to him similar requests had to submit to
similar disappointments, out of which some suspicion was
naturally developed. The recommendation of a remedy
whereof there was no available supply was not a passport
to confidence.</p>

<p>Baron relates, that “Mr. Cline perceiving <em>at once</em> from
the success of his first trial, what incalculable blessings
were connected with the diffusion of the new practice,
immediately advised Jenner to quit the country, and to
take a house in Grosvenor Square, and promised him
£10,000 per annum as the result of his practice; in
which opinion Mr. Cline was supported by Sir W.
Farquhar; but that all these splendid prospects of wealth
and distinction could not move Jenner.”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The story is either an invention, or it does little credit
to Cline’s judgment. Jenner had neither the means for
a house in Grosvenor Square, nor was there any likelihood
of his earning £10,000 a year by cowpox. Nevertheless
it would appear that at this juncture some one
was advising him to try London (one’s vanity is never
without a prompter), and that Jenner replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cheltenham</span>, <em>29th September</em>.</p>

<p>My perplexity really amounts to agitation. On the one hand, unwilling
to come to town myself for the sake of practice, and,
on the other, fearful that the practice I have recommended may
fall into the hands of those who are incapable of conducting
it, I am thrown into a state that was not at first perceptible as
likely to happen to me; for, believe me, I am not callous to all the
feelings of those wounds which, from misrepresentation, might fall
on my reputation; on the contrary, no nerves could feel more
acutely; and they now are actually in a tremor from anticipation.</p>

<p>How very few are capable of conducting physiological experiments!
I am fearful that before we thoroughly understand what
is cowpox matter, and what is not, some confusion may arise, for
which I shall, unjustly, be made answerable.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p></div>

<p>If his correspondent had been a man of sense, he might
have replied&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why so much ado about nothing! You recommend that horsegrease
cowpox be substituted for smallpox in cases of inoculation.
It is a simple prescription, easily determined altogether apart from
you, and there is no reason why you should work yourself into
such a flutter.</p></div>

<p>But Jenner was not the unimpassioned man of science,
who can leave truth to take care of itself, and submit
when truth contradicts his prepossessions. Dr. Ingenhousz,
an Anglicised Dutchman (born at Breda, 1730),
with reputation as electrician and chemist, read the
<cite>Inquiry</cite> with considerable amazement. He was himself
an inoculator of mark, having been selected by the
Empress Maria Teresa to operate upon the imperial
family of Austria; and by her had been rewarded (after
the pattern of Catharine of Russia and Dimsdale) with a
pension of £600 a year, and the titles of Aulic Councillor
and Imperial Physician. Naturally, therefore, Ingenhousz
had a lively interest in Jenner’s project, and being
on a visit to the Marquis of Lansdowne at his seat in
Wiltshire, addressed him as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bowood Park</span>, <em>12th October, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived at Bowood, I thought it my duty to inquire
concerning the extraordinary doctrines contained in your publication,
as I knew the cowpox was well known in this county.</p>

<p>The first gentleman to whom I addressed myself was Mr. Alsop,
an eminent practitioner at Calne, who made me acquainted with
Mr. Henry Stiles, a respectable farmer at Whitley, who, thirty
years ago, bought a cow at a fair, which he found to be infected
with what he called the cowpox. This cow soon infected the whole
dairy; and he himself, by milking the infected cow, caught the
disease which you describe, and that in a very severe way, accompanied
with pain, stiffness, and swelling of the axillary glands.
Having recovered from the disease, and all the sores dried, he was
inoculated with smallpox by Mr. Alsop. The disease took place,
a great many pox came out, and he communicated the infection to
his father who died of it.</p>

<p>This being an incontrovertible fact, cannot fail to make some
impression on your mind, and excite you to inquire further on the
subject before you venture finally to decide in favour of a doctrine,
which may do great mischief should it prove erroneous.</p></div>

<p>The impression made on Jenner’s mind was simply
one of annoyance. He fell back on the assertion that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was not cowpox that was supposed to be cowpox, and
that Farmer Stiles could not have had the genuine
distemper, or he would not have received smallpox by
inoculation. It did not even occur to him that it was
necessary to investigate and account for the evidence
adduced by Ingenhousz, which was every whit as valid
as much of his own. He was content to protest&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the course of my inquiry, not a single instance occurred of
any one having the disease, either casually or from inoculation, who
on subsequent exposure to variolous contagion received the infection
of smallpox.... Should it appear in the present instance
that I have been led into error, fond as I may appear of the offspring
of my labours, I had rather strangle it at once than suffer it
to exist, and do a public injury. At present, I have not the most
distant doubt that any person, who has once felt the influence of
perfect cowpox matter, would ever be susceptible of that of the
smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Could universal conclusion be deduced from more
questionable premisses? and this, too, by one who had
just exclaimed, “How very few are capable of conducting
physiological experiments!” Always, as we shall see;
ungenerous toward those who questioned his assertions,
Jenner wrote to his friend, Gardner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This man, Ingenhousz, knows no more of the real nature of the
cowpox than Master Selwyn does of Greek: yet he is among philosophers
what Johnson was among the literati, and, by the way, not
unlike him in figure&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">When, in fact, what provoked him was that Ingenhousz
knew too much about cowpox, and had laid his
finger on the point of error at the outset. Inquiry on
the part of Ingenhousz brought to light several other
instances of smallpox after cowpox; and Dr. Pulteney of
Blandford reported that Dorsetshire inoculators were
familiar with the one sort of pox after the other sort.
Jenner’s constant answer to such objections was, “Yes;
but it could not have been true cowpox to start with”&mdash;a
style of argument maintained with parrot-like persistency
when smallpox followed vaccination. “Ah!” it
was said, “there must have been some mistake about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
vaccination; for no one can be thoroughly vaccinated
and have smallpox.”</p>

<p>Looking back on the final years of last century, it is
much to be regretted that more pains were not taken to
hold Jenner fast to his position that smallpox never followed
cowpox, and to demonstrate beyond contention
that it was not true. It certainly was not true; the
evidence to that fact was indisputable; but few were
disposed to follow Ingenhousz into the West of England
and search for the requisite proof; and Ingenhousz was
cut out of the controversy by his death at Bowood on 7th
September, 1799. Presently Jenner managed to have
the contention shifted from the experience of the dairies
to vaccination from arm to arm and the illusory variolous
test, and the advantage of a decision at the springs of
fallacy was lost. In the general confusion which ensued
Jenner came to be taken for a discoverer, and he posed
diligently in the character, when he was nothing more
than the advertiser of the vulgar opinion of his neighbourhood,
with the modification that not Cowpox but Horsegrease
Cowpox was the true and infallible specific. The
fact is so clear, that he was a mere advertiser, that it
would not be worth repetition, were it not so systematically
treated as unseen. How distinctly it was at first
recognised appears in a letter of thanks for a copy of the
<cite>Inquiry</cite> addressed to Jenner by Francis Knight, a London
surgeon, wherein he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Clifford Street</span>, <em>10th September, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>I have read your publication with much satisfaction; and, from
a long residence in the dairy part of Wiltshire, as well as in Gloucestershire,
I know the facts to be well supported; at least, it was
a general opinion among the dairymen, that those who had received
the cowpox were not susceptible of the variolous disease. The
cowpox pustule is very familiar to my eye, and I am quite charmed
with the delineation of it in your plates. You have opened to the
world a very curious field of investigation, and it is too interesting
a subject to die with the day.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p></div>

<p>In these remarks of Knight, we have Jenner’s position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
accurately defined. He made himself responsible for
“the general opinion among the dairymen”; and had
some one at that time shown in perspicuous and emphatic
fashion that the dairymen were wrong, Jenner would
have been summarily disposed of. Vain, however, are
such regrets; and we may find comfort in the reflection
that there is an order in the universe which converts
misfortune into means for greater and rarer good.</p>

<p>Another letter to Jenner from Dr. Hicks contains these
remarks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>3rd October, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>I wish you had been able to have communicated the cowpox to
the cow by means of inoculation from a greasy horse’s heel, for
your work would then have been more complete and satisfactory.</p>

<p>I do not see that you need hesitate to accept the invitation given
you to inoculate with the cowpox, convinced as you are that it
will secure the persons so inoculated from ever being infected with
the smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Everlasting security from smallpox! Such was the
unqualified promise, and with how little warrant! In
presence of a Socratic inquirer with his persistent, how
do you know? Jenner must have stood confounded.</p>

<p>A letter to Jenner from Dr. Percival, also contains
some remarks worth notice. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, <em>20th November, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>The facts you have adduced incontestably prove the existence of
the cowpox, and its ready communication to the human species.
But a larger induction is yet necessary to evince that the virus of
the Variolæ Vaccina renders the person who has been affected with
it secure during the whole of life from the infection of the smallpox.</p>

<p>Mr. Simmons, an ingenious surgeon of this town, has inoculated
a human subject with the ichor issuing from what is termed the
grease in horses; but the fluid introduced, though eight punctures
were made, neither occasioned inflammation nor eruption; yet the
same child was soon afterwards inoculated with success for the
smallpox. Mr. Simmons has now engaged a herd of cows, and is
busily employed in making such experiments as your publication
has suggested.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable, that the cowpox has been hitherto unnoticed
in Cheshire, which is not less a dairy county than Gloucestershire,
and where the office of milking is performed also by men and
maid servants indiscriminately.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The frequent statement that Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> was at
first received with indifference is entirely untrue: on the
contrary, it was read with interest from the outset, and
the only check he met was due to his inability to supply
the demands of correspondents for samples of the precious
virus. Cowpox was absent for awhile from the
dairies, and great was his relief and delight when toward
the end of 1798 some matter was obtained from a farm
at Stonehouse wherewith on the 27th November he vaccinated
the children of his friend, Henry Hicks of Eastington;
“the first gentleman,” says Baron, “who had the
merit of submitting his own children to the new practice.”</p>

<p>Ere 1798 had passed away, Jenner had secured an
energetic ally in Dr. George Pearson, F.R.S., Physician to
St. George’s Hospital, London.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Pearson entered into
the cowpox question with his whole heart, and constituted
himself a sort of partner in Jenner’s project. He
wrote to him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Leicester Square</span>, <em>8th November, 1798</em>.</p>

<p>Your name will live in the memory of mankind, as long as men
possess gratitude for services and respect for benefactors; and if I
can but get matter, I am much mistaken if <em>I do make you live for
ever</em>.</p></div>

<p>And in a more decided strain on 13th November&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wish you could secure me matter for inoculation, because, depend
upon it, a thousand inacurate but imposing cases will be published
against the specific nature of the disease by persons who
want to send their names abroad about anything, and who will
think <em>you and me</em> fair game.</p></div>

<p>In the same letter he told Jenner what some were saying
about the suggested practice&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You cannot imagine how fastidious the people are with regard to
this business of the cowpox. One says that it is very filthy and
nasty to derive it from the sore heels of horses. Another, that we
shall introduce the diseases of animals among us, and that we have
already too many of our own. A third sapient set say, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
strange odd kind of business, and they know not what to think of
it. All this I hear very quietly, and recollect that a still more unfavourable
reception was given to inoculation for the smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Such observations were natural and to be expected.
Jenner wrote to Gardner that “brick-bats and hostile
weapons of every sort were flying thick around him,”
but they were chiefly imaginary. His revelation was
communicated to a ready world. It was no revolutionary
project, but a seductive modification of existing
practice. Inoculation with smallpox was the order of
the day among all respectable people. The operation
was troublesome and uncertain, perilous to patients and
to those in contact with them; and, when all was done,
it afforded no unquestionable security against the disease
it was designed to avert. To a community thus harassed
and anxious, came Jenner with his prescription and his
promise&mdash;Substitute cowpox for smallpox and you will
escape from this distress, danger, doubt. You will have
a harmless fever without pustules and without risk of
infection, and the security from smallpox will be absolute
and perpetual. What wonder that in such circumstances
Jenner’s message was heard gladly and accepted with
grateful enthusiasm. That he should have encountered
some resistance was inevitable, for what change is ever
effected without opposition and ominous prediction?
But the change Jenner proposed was the slightest of
changes with the largest prospects of advantage. Unless
these conditions are borne in mind, we shall never rightly
understand the reception accorded by our forefathers to
inoculation with cowpox.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dr. Pearson’s <cite>Inquiry concerning the History of the
Cowpox</cite><a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> is a remarkable proof of the alacrity and
energy with which Jenner’s project was entertained.
As observed, Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> was published at the end
of June, 1798, and ere six months were over, in November,
1798, appeared Pearson’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>, a masterly review of
Jenner’s; and not only a review, but a record of investigation,
personal and by correspondence with country
physicians and farmers; the entire work displaying a
capacity for business to which Jenner was wholly unequal.</p>

<p>Cowpox did not come before Pearson as a novelty, nor
Jenner in connection therewith. He relates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When I was in company with the late Mr. John Hunter, about
nine years ago, I heard him communicate the information he had
received from Dr. Jenner, that in Gloucestershire an infectious disorder
frequently prevailed among the milch cows, named the Cowpox,
in which there was an eruption on their teats; that those who
milked such cows were liable to be affected with pustulous eruptions
on their hands, which were also called the cowpox; that such
persons as had undergone this <span class="fs80">DISEASE COULD NOT BE INFECTED
BY THE VARIOLOUS POISON</span>; and that as no patient had been known
to die of the Cowpox, the practice of the inoculation of the poison
of this disease, to supersede the Smallpox, might be found, on experience,
to be a great improvement in physic.</p>

<p>I noted these observations, and constantly related them, when
on the subject of Smallpox, in every course of lectures which I have
given since that time. (P. 5.)</p></div>

<p>The communication of Jenner to Hunter was nothing
of a discovery. There was no secret in the existence of
Cowpox, nor in the belief that inoculation therewith
fortified the sufferer against Smallpox. Dr. Pulteney, of
Blandford, informed Pearson that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox is well known in Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire,
and Devonshire. It is not unknown in Leicestershire, and
other midland counties; but dairymen keep it a secret as much as
possible, as it is disreputable to the cleanliness of their produce.
(P. 8.)</p></div>

<p>In the northern counties and in Wales, Cowpox was
either rarely seen or unknown. In Cheshire, as much
of a dairy county as Gloucestershire, where also men
acted as milkers, the disease was never met with.
Where, however, Cowpox was recognised, the faith in its
efficacy against Smallpox appeared to be general, and
inoculators regarded it as a bar to their success. Thus
Mr. Giffard, surgeon, Gillingham, wrote to Pearson, 9th
August, 1798&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox is more known in Dorsetshire than in most counties.
Last winter I inoculated three parishes, and some of the subjects
told me they had had the Cowpox, and that they should not take
the Smallpox; but I desired to inoculate them, and did so two
or three times, but without effect. Persons never take the Smallpox
after they have had the Cowpox. (P. 14.)</p></div>

<p>At a milk-farm on the Hampstead Road, Pearson found
a man who had often seen Cowpox in Wiltshire and
Gloucestershire. He said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He had known many who had had Cowpox, and they never suffered
from the Smallpox, although it prevailed in their own families.
To use his own words, they who have had the Cowpox “are hard
to take the Smallpox.” (P. 29.)</p></div>

<p>Mr. Rolph, surgeon, Peckham, who had practised in
Gloucestershire, informed Pearson that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox was very frequently epizootic in the dairy-farms in the
spring.... A great number of instances of the Cowpox in
milkers had fallen under his observation, but not a single mortal,
or even dangerous, case occurred. There was not a medical man
in Gloucestershire, or scarce a dairy-farmer, who did not know
from his own experience, or that of others, that those who have
suffered the Cowpox are exempt from the agency of the variolous
poison. (P. 95.)</p></div>

<p>Dr. Croft likewise told Pearson&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That in Staffordshire to his knowledge, the fact had been long
known of the Cowpox, which prevails in that county, affording an
exemption of the human subjects from the Smallpox. (P. 35.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did what was so widely believed escape mention
in medical literature. Thus Dr. Beddoes, in <cite>Queries
concerning Inoculation</cite>, had written in 1795&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have learnt from my own observation, and the testimony of
some old practitioners, that susceptibility to the Smallpox is destroyed
by the Cowpox, which is a malady more unpleasant than
dangerous.</p></div>

<p>And Dr. Adams, in his treatise on <cite>Morbid Poisons</cite>,
1795, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox is a disease well known to the dairy-farmers in Gloucestershire.
What is extraordinary, as far as facts have hitherto been
ascertained, a person infected with Cowpox is rendered insensible
to the variolous poison.</p></div>

<p>And Dr. Woodville in his <cite>History of Inoculation</cite>,
1796, argued&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been conjectured that the Smallpox might have been derived
from some disease of brute animals; and, if it be true that
the mange affecting dogs, can communicate a species of itch to
man; or that a person, having received a certain disorder from
handling the teats of cows, is thereby rendered insensible to variolous
infection ever afterwards&mdash;then, indeed, the conjecture is not
improbable.</p></div>

<p>The belief, moreover, that Cowpox was good against
Smallpox, had tempted several to court the disease. The
Rev. Herman Drewe wrote to Pearson of himself and
Mr. Bragge, surgeon, Axminster, 5th July, 1798&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Bragge and I endeavoured to try the experiment of inoculating
with the matter of the Cowpox, but from the scarceness of
the disease, and unwillingness of patients, we were disappointed.
(P. 39.)</p></div>

<p>Mr. Dolling of Blandford related that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Justings, of Axminster, inoculated his wife and children with
matter taken from the teats of a cow that had the Cowpox. In
about a week afterwards their arms were very much inflamed, and
the patients were so ill that the medical assistance of Mr. Meach,
of Cerne, was called for. The patients did well. They were afterwards
inoculated for the Smallpox by Mr. Trobridge without effect.
(P. 42.)</p></div>

<p>Dr. Pulteney of Blandford informed Pearson that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A respectable practitioner inoculated seven children for the Smallpox,
five of whom had been purposely infected with the Cowpox by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
being made to handle the teats and udders of cows under the disease,
and in consequence contracted the distemper. These five,
after inoculation for the Smallpox, did not sicken, whilst the other
two did. (P. 39.)</p></div>

<p>These cases were examples of many; and if it be
asked, why were not such inoculations repeated, we may
take an answer from Mr. Fewster, surgeon, of Thornbury,
who, in a practice of thirty years in Gloucestershire,
inoculated thousands with Smallpox, and had known
“numberless instances of Cowpox.” He wrote, 11th
October, 1798&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In general, I think, Cowpox is a much more severe disease than
the inoculated Smallpox; nor do I see any great advantage from
its inoculation. Smallpox inoculation seems to be so well understood
that there is very little need of a substitute. It is curious,
however, and may lead to other improvements. (P. 104.)</p></div>

<p>To show still further how Jenner’s communication was
“in the air” ready for descent. Mr. Downe, surgeon of
Bridport, wrote to Pearson, 1st August, 1798&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A few years ago when I inoculated a great number for the Smallpox,
I remarked that I could not by any means infect one or two
of them; and, on inquiry, I was informed that they had previously
been infected with the Cowpox. I know that a medical man in
this part of the country was injured in his practice by a prejudice
raised unjustly that <em>he intended to substitute the Cowpox for the
Smallpox in inoculation</em>. So great an enemy to improvement are
the prejudices of the public in the country, that I think experiments
of importance can only be made in hospitals. (P. 10.)</p></div>

<p>Thus popular scandal anticipated what was called
Jenner’s discovery!</p>

<p>Nor was Pearson content simply to inquire of others:
he experimented himself, and put Cowpox to the test a
week or so before the appearance of Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>.
He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Happening, on the 14th of June, to be with Mr. Lucas, apothecary,
on professional business at Mr. Willan’s farm, adjoining the
New Road, Marylebone, where from 800 to 1000 milch cows are
kept, I availed myself of the opportunity to make inquiry concerning
the Cowpox. I was told it was a pretty frequent disease among
the cows of that farm, especially in winter, and that it was supposed
to arise from sudden change from poor to rich food. It was
also well known to the servants, some of whom had been affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with the malady from milking the diseased cows. On investigation,
I found that three of the men-servants, namely, Thomas Edinburgh,
Thomas Grimshaw, and John Clarke had been affected with
the Cowpox, but not with the Smallpox. I induced them to be
inoculated for the Smallpox, and, with the view of ascertaining the
efficacy of the variolous infection employed, William Kent and
Thomas East, neither of whom had either the Cowpox or the
Smallpox, were also inoculated. (P. 14.)</p></div>

<p>The result conformed to expectation: Edinburgh,
Grimshaw, and Clarke did not take Smallpox, even
though inoculation was repeated, whilst Kent and East
did. Pearson set forth his experiments much more
philosophically than Jenner, but his bias was pronounced,
and it blinded him to some obvious considerations; and it
is marvellous how easily we may accumulate details for
which we have a fancy. Summing up the testimonies
he had collected, he held that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The body of evidence is numerous and respectable, declaring that
a person who has laboured under the Cowpox fever and local eruption,
is not susceptible of the Smallpox. It does not appear that a
single well authenticated contravening instance has fallen under
observation. But I do not apprehend that accurate and able reasoners
will consider the fact as completely established, though, I
doubt not, they will allow that the testimonies now produced greatly
confirm the probability, and that the cautious appropriation of it
in practice is warrantable. (P. 64.)</p></div>

<p>In this summary we perceive the limit and imperfection
of Pearson’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>. Smallpox <em>did</em> follow Cowpox: it
was well known that it did: and Dr. Ingenhousz ascertained
the fact as soon as he looked for it. Moreover
Pearson showed himself ignorant of Jenner’s position,
who, recognising the fallacy of the rural superstition,
was compelled to discriminate Cowpox as genuine and
spurious&mdash;the genuine being the variety derived from
Horsegrease.</p>

<p>Upon Jenner’s assertion that Cowpox was unaltered by
transmission from arm to arm, Pearson remarked, “The
fact remained to be proved.” That Cowpox produced a
harmless ailment was not, he thought, to be hastily assumed.
Dr. William Heberden had recently inoculated
800 poor persons at Hungerford without a mishap, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
1700 had passed through Dr. Woodville’s hands in the
current year (1798) with only two deaths; yet how
erroneous would be to argue that variolous inoculation
was harmless from such special experience!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such instances of success can only be attributed to a certain
favourable epidemic state of the human constitution itself, existing
at particular times, for the proportion of deaths from inoculation is
usually much greater, owing, probably, to certain unfavourable
epidemic states. (P. 67.)</p></div>

<p>If Cowpox remained unchanged in transmission from
arm to arm, it would be no harmless ailment; for the
evidence was distinct that it was frequently a severe one.
For example, Edinburgh told Pearson that when suffering
from Cowpox he had to give up work and go into an
hospital; and Grimshaw that the disease was uncommonly
painful, with swellings in his armpits, sore to the
touch; and the servant at Rhodes’s farm in the Hampstead
Road, who had seen much Cowpox in Wiltshire
and Gloucestershire, said the milkers were sometimes so
ill that they had to keep their beds for several days,
though none ever died of the Cowpox fever. If, however,
by transmission from arm to arm, Cowpox became
milder, it was not improbable that at the same time it
would lose more or less of its protective efficacy.</p>

<p>Pearson might have seen and added, that resistance to
inoculated Smallpox, when the constitution was in no
humour for Smallpox, was no proof that the same constitution
would resist Smallpox when epidemic, or in
condition for the evolution of the disease.</p>

<p>Pearson likewise took objection to Jenner’s evidence
(such as it was) that it was possible to take Cowpox
after Cowpox, but not Smallpox after Cowpox; saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most of professional men are extremely reluctant in yielding
assent to this statement. Some, indeed, reject it in the most unqualified
terms. That Cowpox follows Cowpox appears certain,
but that Cowpox should avert Smallpox, and not avert itself appears
incredible. (P. 44.)</p></div>

<p>Here we see Pearson on the verge of discovery of the
illusion, but with all his training and Yorkshire shrewdness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he lost the scent, and allowed himself to be deceived;
and not only deceived, but to become a prime mover in
the deception of the world. Jenner felt the difficulty
and replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cheltenham</span>, <em>27th September, 1798</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You may be assured that a person may be repeatedly
affected, both locally and generally, by the Cowpox, two instances
of which I have adduced, and have many more in my recollection;
but, nevertheless, I have some reason to suspect that my discriminations
have not been, till lately, sufficiently nice.... Certain
it is, that the skin is always subject to the ulcerative effects of the
virus; but whether the constitution can repeatedly feel the primary
effects of it, I have experiments in view to determine. (P. 99.)</p></div>

<p>This passage is commended to those who hold with
Mr. John Simon that Jenner delivered to the world “a
Master-piece of Medical Induction,” the fruit of thirty
years of incessant thought, watching and experiment.
It is plain that in 1798 the very elements of the problem
were by him undetermined, and the most obvious objections
unforeseen and unconsidered.</p>

<p>Pearson’s strongest opposition was reserved for the
asserted origin of Cowpox in Horsegrease. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has no better support than the coincidence in some instances
of the two diseases in the same farm in which the same servants
are employed among the Horses and Cows.</p>

<p>I have found that in many farms the Cowpox breaks out although
no new-comer has been introduced to the herd; although the
milkers do not come in contact with the Horses; although there
are no greased Horses; and even although there are no Horses kept
on the farm.</p>

<p>It appears that the Cowpox does not break out under the most
favourable circumstances, if it be occasioned by <em>the Grease</em>. “I
have had,” writes Sir Isaac Pennington, Cambridge, 14th September,
1798, “Dr. Jenner’s book some weeks, and the particulars
stated in it are really astonishing. I have made inquiries upon the
subject at Cottenham and Willingham, in which two parishes 3000
milch Cows are kept; also a great many Horses of the rough-legged
cart kind (much liable to the scratches or grease) half the
parishes being under the plough, and the men much employed in
milking. But I cannot find that any pustulous eruptions on the
teats of the Cows, or on the hands of the milkers, have ever been
heard of.” (P. 82.)</p></div>

<p>In the opening of his <cite>Inquiry</cite>, Pearson was good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
enough to say of Jenner, “I would not pluck a sprig of
laurel from the wreath that decorates his brow”; but,
disputing the origin of genuine Cowpox in Horsegrease,
he might have asked himself, what sprig of laurel he had
left. That Cowpox originated in Horsegrease was not
Jenner’s discovery. As Pearson ascertained in the
London milk farms, “There was such a notion entertained
in several parts of the country, whatever might be its
foundation.” (P. 86.) But the definition of Horsegrease
Cowpox as the form of Cowpox that justified the faith
of the country-folk in the power of the disease to avert
Smallpox, was Jenner’s solitary distinction&mdash;the principle
and motive of his <cite>Inquiry</cite>, which, to prove fallacious,
was to extinguish his title to regard. Cowpox apart
from Horsegrease was clearly taught by Jenner to have
no influence on the constitution, and to be attended with
no erysipelas. “Let me call your attention,” he wrote to
Pearson, 27th September, 1798, “to a similarity between
the Smallpox and the Cowpox when inoculated. The
symptoms of absorption first disturb the system, and,
secondly, the system feels the consequences of the local
sores. Exactly so with the Cowpox; and <em>as the Cowpox
inflammation is always of the erysipelatous kind</em>,
when it spreads over the skin to any great extent, it
produces symptoms not unlike the confluent Smallpox.”
(P. 100.)</p>

<p>Pearson foresaw that if the principle of inoculation
with Cowpox were established it would lead to other
applications&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Cow Poison appears to alter the human constitution, so as
to render it insusceptible of a different morbific poison, namely, the
variolous in producing the Smallpox. This fact is, I believe, quite
a novelty in physiology and pathology: it indicates a new principle
in the mode of prophylactic practice. And we now see a principle
upon which diseases from various other morbific poisons may possibly
be prevented from taking place, such as the Measles, Ulcerous
Sore Throat, Hooping Cough, Syphilis, etc., namely, in consequence
of destroying the excitability of the constitution to such poisons by
the agency of different, and perhaps less hurtful ones. Whether
the Cowpox preserves the constitution from other morbific poisons,
besides the variolous, is an undecided question. (P. 79.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Like Jenner, he also recognised in Cowpox a counter-irritant&mdash;a
safe sort of fever that might be used to drive
off other diseases&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If it be true that the same constitution is liable to undergo repeatedly
the Cowpox, to which distemper no one has fallen a victim,
practitioners may avail themselves of this means of exciting an
innocent fever as a remedy of various disorders; it being a truth,
admitted by men of experience, that fevers are occasionally efficacious
remedies, especially for inveterate chronic maladies, such as
Epilepsy, Hysteria, Insanity, St. Vitus’s Dance, Tetanus, skin deformities
and diseases, etc. (P. 81.)</p></div>

<p>Nor was the notion without warrant, for Smallpox
itself was credited with a double action as a generator
and exterminator of disease&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disposition to certain diseases, and even diseases themselves,
are not rarely brought on by the Smallpox; but sometimes also
dispositions to diseases, and diseases themselves of the most inveterate
kind are removed by the Smallpox. (P. 77.)</p></div>

<p>In one respect, Jenner showed himself superior to
Pearson, namely, in offering some explanation of Cowpox.
Pearson accepted the disease on the rural terms&mdash;as an
eruption on Cows attended with no serious illness. If
in any way such Pox was equivalent to Smallpox, it was
inexplicable that it should be limited to the udder and
teats of milch cattle, and that males, and females not in
milk, should be exempt from infection. A disease so
unique wanted accounting for; but Pearson made no
attempt to account for it, nor gave any sign that he
apprehended the difficulty. Jenner, on the other hand,
accounted for Pox on the Cow by referring it to infection
from the Horse conveyed by the milkers, which explanation
Pearson rejected. But in giving Jenner credit for
so much, let it not be for over much. Whilst he ascribed
Cowpox to a credible cause, he did not recognise his
advantage and summon gainsayers to explain how Cowpox,
as described by them, could exist without Bullpox.
On the contrary, as we shall see, Jenner submitted to be
silenced on this point for reasons far from creditable.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">WOODVILLE, PEARSON AND JENNER.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Another early and earnest examiner of Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>
was Dr. William Woodville, physician to the London
Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital. He was a Cumberland
man, born at Cockermouth, 1752; a member of the
Society of Friends. An ardent botanist, he turned two
acres of the ground around the Hospital at King’s Cross
into a botanic garden, which he maintained at his own
expense. He died of a chronic pulmonary complaint in
1805, and in his last illness had himself removed from
his house in Ely Place to the Hospital for the sake of
the garden and the country air.</p>

<p>Woodville was eager to try cowpox, but Jenner had
no supply, nor could any be had elsewhere. He therefore
resorted to horsegrease, but could make nothing of
it. In his own words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Conceiving that the distemper might be produced by inoculating
the nipples of Cows with the matter of the grease of Horses, I proceeded
to try whether the Cowpox could be actually excited in this
manner. Numerous experiments were accordingly made upon
different Cows with the matter of grease, taken in the various stages
of that disease, but without producing the desired effect.</p>

<p>Neither were inoculations with this matter, nor with several
other morbid secretions in the Horse, productive of any effects upon
the human subject.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p></div>

<p>Thrice in person did Woodville submit to inoculation
with horsegrease, but in vain. Others in London and
elsewhere attempted to raise pox on cows in the same
way without result save malediction on Jenner for
originating such a troublesome quest.</p>

<p>Thus closed 1798 with many anxious to try the new
prescription whenever there was a chance. Early in the
new year, there was a cry in London, ’Tis found! ’tis
found! In Harrison’s dairy, Gray’s Inn Road, close by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Smallpox Hospital, cowpox was discovered, and thither
hastened Woodville, Pearson, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir
William Watson, Dr. Garthshore, Dr. Willan, and other
medical men; and in their presence, on 19th January,
Woodville inoculated six patients with the pox.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The
eruptions on the cows’ teats were diligently compared
with the description and plates in Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>, and
pronounced identical. Four-fifths of the 200 cows in the
dairy became affected, those not in milk escaping the
disease; likewise some of the milkers, the first being
Sarah Rice, who had undergone smallpox in childhood&mdash;a
proof that smallpox did not prevent cowpox. “At the
same time,” wrote Dr. Pearson, “I received the agreeable
intelligence that the disease was also raging in the
largest stock of cows on the New Road, near Paddington,
to which no one could gain admittance but myself.”</p>

<p>With cowpox thus provided in abundance, Pearson
and Woodville set to work&mdash;Woodville at his Hospital,
and Pearson in private practice. Be it observed, however,
that this London cowpox was not Jenner’s cowpox.
It was not horsegrease cowpox, but the variety stigmatised
by Jenner as spurious. How Pearson and Woodville
pressed forward with their enterprise appears from
the following letter, enclosing cowpox threads, sent by
Pearson to two hundred medical practitioners throughout
the United Kingdom&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Leicester Square</span>, <em>12th March, 1799</em>.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I hope you will pardon me for taking the liberty to inform
you (by way of additional evidence to the testimonies I have published
on the subject of the Cowpox) that upwards of 160 patients,
from two weeks to forty years of age, principally infants, have been
inoculated since the 20th January last by Dr. Woodville and myself,
separately....</p>

<p>Not one mortal case has occurred.</p>

<p>Not one of the patients has been dangerously ill....</p>

<p>None of the patients, namely above 60, inoculated with the Smallpox,
subsequently to the Vaccine Disease, took the infection....</p>

<p>In many of the cases eruptions of the body appeared, some of
which could not be distinguished from the Smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>I have sent the matter of Cowpox pustules on the thread enclosed,
in order, if you approve of the inquiry, to inoculate with it; and I
entreat you to favour me with the result of your trials: but I must
trouble you to apply the test of inoculating with variolous matter
subsequently to the vaccine disorder.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">George Pearson</span>, M.D., F.R.S.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am happy to be able to state that at Berkeley, Dr. Jenner
has continued his trials of inoculation with vaccine matter sent
from London with good success.</p></div>

<p>Jenner was of an indolent disposition, but the part
Pearson was playing stung him to action. His nephew,
Rev. G. C. Jenner, wrote to him from London, and thus
roused his jealousy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Norfolk Street</span>, <em>11th March, 1799</em>.</p>

<p>After what Mr. Paytherus has written to you it will be needless
for me to say anything to urge the necessity of your coming to
town to wear the laurels you have gained, or to prevent their being
placed on the brows of another....</p>

<p>Dr. Pearson is going to send circular letters to medical gentlemen
to let them know that he will supply them with Cowpox matter
upon their application to him, by which means <em>he</em> will be the
chief person known in the business, and consequently deprive you
of that merit, or at least a great share of it, which is so justly your
due. Dr. Pearson gave a public lecture on the Cowpox on Saturday,
and adopted your opinions, except with regard to the probability
of the disease originating in Horses’ heels.... All your
friends agree that <em>now</em> is your time to establish your fame and fortune;
but if you delay taking a personal active part any longer,
the opportunity will be lost for ever.&mdash;Your affectionate nephew,
<span class="smcap">G. C. Jenner</span>.</p></div>

<p>Jenner at once communicated the alarming intelligence
to his friend Gardner with a sly suggestion for counter-action&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, <em>Wednesday</em>.</p>

<p>A letter just received from G. Jenner informs me that Dr. Pearson
on Saturday gave a public lecture on the Cowpox, and that it
was publicly exhibited at Sir Joseph Banks’s on Sunday evening.
He has also given out that he will furnish any gentleman at a distance
with the virus.</p>

<p>As this is probably done with the view of showing himself as the
first man in the concern, should not some neatly drawn paragraphs
appear from time to time in the public prints, by no means reflecting
on the conduct of P., but just to keep the idea publicly alive
that P. was not the author of the discovery&mdash;I mean of Cowpox
Inoculation.&mdash;Yours truly, E. J.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>As human nature exists, it was not extraordinary that
Jenner should feel anxious over the occupation of ground
he considered his own; but at the same time it is obvious,
that Pearson had done nothing wrong, nothing that was
not allowable, nothing indeed that was not praiseworthy.
He allowed Jenner full credit for having advertised the
Gloucestershire faith in cowpox, and for the production
of certain evidence for that faith; but he set aside
Jenner’s prescription of horsegrease cowpox, and was
making use of a form of cowpox that Jenner had explicitly
condemned. Whilst Jenner, too, had excited
curiosity, he did nothing, or could do nothing, to satisfy
it; and it was idle to expect the world to await his convenience:
nor was Pearson the man to rest content where
action was possible. As he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the time of the publication of the <cite>Inquiry</cite> in June, 1798,
the author contributed no further inoculated cases to the end of
that year; nor could I do more than investigate the history of the
Cowpox principally by inquiries among provincial physicians and
farmers, from whom I was enabled to confirm some of the facts in
Dr. Jenner’s book, and to render doubtful or disprove others, and
to bring to light new observations.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner was not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'slow to repond'">slow to respond</ins> to his nephew’s summons
to London. He left Berkeley on the 21st of March,
and remained in town until the 11th of June, visiting
medical men, asserting his own claims, and counter-acting
the operations of Pearson and Woodville.</p>

<p>In Dr. Pearson’s circular, it will be observed, that he
described inoculation with cowpox as attended with
eruptions in some cases, which could not be distinguished
from smallpox. So far as Pearson and Woodville were
concerned, it was an unfortunate statement, and gave
Jenner an advantage over them which he used unsparingly
to their discredit.</p>

<p>Jenner’s claim for inoculation with cowpox was, that
it excited a fever that was not infectious and was without
pustular eruptions; and here was Dr. Pearson setting
up as his critic, and Dr. Woodville assuming to develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
his practice, and producing a disorder that was indistinguishable
from smallpox! Such presumption and
ignorance deserved to be hooted.</p>

<p>What was the explanation? Simply this: that Woodville
conducted some of his cowpox inoculations in the
variolous atmosphere of his Hospital, and that he thereby
communicated smallpox and cowpox simultaneously. In
a scientific sense, the experience was valuable; it proved
that it was possible to have cowpox and smallpox at the
same time&mdash;that neither disease superseded or nullified
the other.</p>

<p>Woodville tried to vindicate himself, and in his failure
magnified Jenner’s triumph still further. Yet he had
much that was reasonable to say for himself. For
example, he had transmitted to Jenner some of the virus
from one of the first of his cowpox inoculations in
January, and with it Jenner operated on twenty persons,
reporting to Woodville&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, <em>February, 1799</em>.<br /></p>

<p>The rise, progress, and termination of the pustules created by
the virus were exactly that of the true Cowpox.</p></div>

<p>Nevertheless, wrote Woodville&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This virus which Dr. Jenner declared to be perfectly pure and
genuine was taken from the arm of an hospital patient who had
310 pustules, all of which suppurated.</p></div>

<p>Woodville also argued, that “Cowpox, as casually
produced by milking infected cows, differs considerably
from that which is the effect of inoculation”; which
Jenner attested in saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Four or five servants were inoculated at a farm contiguous to
Berkeley last summer with matter just taken from an infected
Cow. A little inflammation appeared on all their arms, but died
away without producing a pustule; yet all these servants caught
the disease within a month afterwards from milking the infected
Cows, and some of them had it severely.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p></div>

<p>Others maintained that the cowpox which saved milkmaids
from smallpox was a much severer affection than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that induced by Jenner’s lancet, and that it was folly to
assume their equivalence. There was force in the argument;
for every one then knew how much the issue
of smallpox inoculation depended on the mode of its
performance. The infection when communicated through
the skin was usually much less severe than when communicated
by incision; and Jenner related how a country
inoculator, who liked to “cut deep enough to see a bit of
fat,” was the death of his patients on every side. The
human body is of infinite delicacy and complexity, and
we are sure to find ourselves at fault when we deal with
its mysteries according to our crude and inanimate logic.
It is by experiment and not by syllogism that physiological
truth is verified.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the perils, immediate or remote, of
inoculation with cowpox, it was not attended with smallpox
eruption; and at last it became manifest to Woodville
himself, that the virus he had used, and the virus
he had distributed, which had produced such eruption,
was the virus of smallpox.</p>

<p>After much controversy and many experiments these
conclusions were arrived at&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That when a person was inoculated with smallpox
and cowpox about the same time, both inoculations
proved effective. There was a pustular eruption on the
skin from the smallpox, and the cowpox vesicle reached
maturity in the usual number of days.</p>

<p>2. These effects took place, without much variation, in
all cases where the interval between the two inoculations
did not exceed a week; but&mdash;</p>

<p>3. When the smallpox matter was inserted on the
ninth day after the inoculation with cowpox, its action
seemed to be wholly precluded.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>That is to say, for a time&mdash;until the influence of the
vaccine fever had worn off. Some fancied that smallpox
when inoculated with cowpox generated a hybrid pox
that was more efficacious than either. There was occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
some interaction of the diseases, as of a subdued
activity in each, but generally they proceeded together
unaffected, the cowpox maintaining its characteristics in
the midst of a crop of smallpox.</p>

<p>One point of great significance in Woodville’s experience
was overlooked. He inoculated with cowpox in the
Smallpox Hospital, and some of his patients there contracted
smallpox, who certainly were not inoculated with
smallpox, either accidentally or by design. The lesson
of this experience was unperceived, and though it has
been repeated again and again, is rarely acknowledged.
Vaccination in presence of smallpox, or in an epidemic of
smallpox, is often a means of inducing the disease it is
intended to prevent. It lights the fire; and when the
fire is lighted, it is said, “Ah! it must have been a-light
before.” When we have a mind for an excuse, our
sophistry is usually equal to the requisition.</p>

<p>The New Inoculation, as it was called, grew in favour
daily. Woodville and Pearson did the real work of
publicity and promotion&mdash;Pearson especially. Within
seven months, January to August, 1799, they performed
2000 inoculations. In the <cite>Philosophical Journal</cite>,
August, 1799, Pearson observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Scotland the New Inoculation has not been less successful.
Dr. Anderson, of Leith, informs me that he has inoculated above
80 persons; that Dr. Duncan has begun the practice in Edinburgh
and that it has been introduced in Dundee, Paisley, and Dalkeith.</p></div>

<p>Nor did Pearson limit his efforts to his native land.
He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the course of the same year, 1799, I extended the dissemination
of the vaccine matter to Germany, for the Princess Louisa at
Berlin, to Hanover, Vienna, Geneva, Lisbon, Paris, and Boston,
and into the British Army through Mr. Keats.</p></div>

<p>Jenner regarded much of this activity with a jealous
eye: it did not sufficiently make for his glory. He was
anxious, fretful, helpless. “It is impossible for me, single-handed,
to combat all my adversaries,” was his whine.
“I am beset on all sides with snarling fellows, and so
ignorant withal that they know no more of the disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
they write about than the animals which generate it.”
In order to keep his name to the fore, he published a
second pamphlet in the spring of 1799, in which are
several details of biographical interest.</p>

<p class="noindent">This pamphlet appears to have been produced with many
pains and extraordinary apprehensions. Jenner wrote to
Gardner, 7th March, 1799&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every sentence must be again revised and weighed in the
nicest balance that human intellect can invent. The eyes of the
philosophic and medical critic, prejudiced most bitterly against the
hypothesis, will penetrate its inmost recesses, and discover the
minutest flaw were it suffered to be present. Language I put out

<p>These words betray excitement for which there was no
warrant; and when we turn to the treatise that was to be
weighed sentence by sentence in the nicest of balances, it
is clearly seen that its author was a weak-minded creature.
It is little more than a gossip about Cowpox without
advance upon the statements of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>. Indeed,
he sets out with the admission&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although it has not been in my power to extend the Inquiry into
the causes and effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ much beyond its
original limits, yet, perceiving that it is beginning to excite a
general spirit of investigation, I think it is of importance, without
delay, to communicate such facts as have since occurred, and to
point out the fallacious sources from whence a disease resembling
the true Variolæ Vaccinæ might arise, with the view of preventing
those who may inoculate from producing a spurious disease; and
further, to enforce the precaution suggested in the former Treatise
on the subject, of subduing the inoculated pustule as soon as it
has sufficiently produced its influence on the constitution. (P. 69.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes when it is objected that the evidence adduced
in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> was hastily collected, meagre and
inconclusive, it is replied, “Yes, but recollect, it was
merely a selection, if a poor one, from the author’s
stores”&mdash;a reply which Jenner thus renders nugatory in
recording&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My late publication contains a relation of <em>most of the facts which
had come under my own inspection at the time it was written</em>,
interspersed with some conjectural observations&mdash;(P. 70)&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Which is exactly what any perspicacious reader would
infer from the cases adduced in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>. They
were Jenner’s best and his all. Meanwhile, as observed,
he had been able to do little in extension of the Inquiry;
but if idle and helpless, Dr. Pearson had been active&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since then Dr. George Pearson has established an inquiry into
the validity of my principal assertion, the result of which cannot
but be highly flattering to my feelings. It contains [Pearson’s
<cite>Inquiry</cite>] not a single case which I think can be called an exception
to the fact I was so firmly impressed with&mdash;that the Cowpox
protects the human body from the Smallpox. (P. 70.)</p></div>

<p>Here we have a distinct mis-statement. It was not
Jenner’s “fact” that Cowpox protected the human body
from Smallpox&mdash;that was a widespread superstition.
His contribution to the question was a definition of the
Cowpox effective against Smallpox, namely Horsegrease
Cowpox, other Cowpox being adjudged spurious. Pearson
so far from confirming Jenner’s position, deliberately
set it aside. He not only accepted the rural faith in
Cowpox (which Jenner knew to be unwarrantable), but,
when he proceeded to practice, made use of Cowpox
which owed nothing to Horsegrease. If therefore Pearson’s
procedure was “highly flattering” to Jenner’s
feelings, he was either easily pleased, or an adept in
dissimulation.</p>

<p>The truth is, the publication of <cite>Further Observations</cite>
was designed by Jenner to loosen himself from what was
definite in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, so that he might be able to
appropriate whatever might result from the investigations
and experiments then going on. He had defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
prophylactic Cowpox as Horsegrease Cowpox, but Horsegrease
did not meet with favour, nor appear likely to
answer; and it might be expedient to drop it; and thus
he described the ground of his attachment to that form
of specific&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Firstly.&mdash;I conceived that Horsegrease was the source of Cowpox
from observing that where the Cowpox had appeared among the
dairies here [Berkeley] (unless it could be traced to the introduction
of an infected cow or servant) it had been preceded at the farm
by a Horse diseased in the manner described, which Horse had
been attended by some of the milkers.</p>

<p>Secondly.&mdash;From its being a popular opinion throughout this
great dairy country, and from its being insisted on by those who
here attend sick cattle.</p>

<p>Thirdly.&mdash;From the total absence of the disease in those countries
where the men servants are not employed in the dairies.</p>

<p>Fourthly.&mdash;From having observed that morbid matter generated
by the Horse frequently communicates, in a casual way, a disease
to the human subject so like the Cowpox, that in many cases it
would be difficult to make the distinction between one and the
other.</p>

<p>Fifthly.&mdash;From being induced to suppose from experiments, that
some of those who had been thus affected from the Horse resisted
the Smallpox.</p>

<p>Sixthly.&mdash;From the progress and general appearance of the
pustule on the arm of the boy whom I inoculated with matter taken
from the hand of a man infected by a Horse; and from the
similarity to the Cowpox of the general constitutional symptoms
which followed. (P. 91.)</p></div>

<p>The boy inoculated with secondary Horsegrease was
Baker, Case xviii. of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>. He died of fever in
the parish workhouse before he could be subjected to the
variolous test.</p>

<p>Jenner’s drift in the foregoing propositions was obviously
to lighten his responsibility for the advocacy of
Horsegrease as the origin of Cowpox; but in doing so he
deprived himself of any vestige of claim as a discoverer.
Cowpox and Horsegrease as preventives of Smallpox
were in common repute; but their combination as Horsegrease
Cowpox was supposed by some to be Jenner’s
peculiar specific. “Not so,” he said. “It is the popular
opinion throughout the country that Cowpox is begotten
of Horsegrease;” and proceeded to justify his prescription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by the popular authority. He produced a letter from
Parson Moore of Chalford Hill to prove how in November,
1797, his Horse had the Grease, with which his boy-servant
infected the Cow, which in turn infected the
lad with Cowpox, although eighteen months before he
had been inoculated, and severely too, with Smallpox;
the parson adding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am firmly of opinion that the disease in the heels of the Horse,
which was a virulent Grease, was the origin of the Servant’s and
the Cow’s malady. (P. 94.)</p></div>

<p>To the objection that attempts to raise Cowpox from
Horsegrease had, so far, proved failures, Jenner replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The experiments published by Mr. Simmons of Manchester and
others on the subject, with the view of refuting the origin of Cowpox
in Horsegrease, appear to have but little weight, as even the
Cowpock Virus itself, when repeatedly introduced into the sound
nipples of Cows by means of a lancet, was found to produce no
effect. (P. 93.)</p></div>

<p>Having reached this point, I would beg the reader to
pause and ask, What was Jenner’s discovery? It was
not Cowpox; it was not Horsegrease; it was not Horsegrease
Cowpox; all of which by his own admission were
recognised by those familiar with them as preventives of
Smallpox. What was it then?</p>

<p>Nothing is more conspicuous in the <cite>Further Observations</cite>
than the condition of ignorance and imbecility they
reveal. As we have seen, critics of the order of Mr. John
Simon represent Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> as a Masterpiece of
Medical Induction, the fruit of thirty years of incessant
thought, observation and experiment; whilst the patience,
the caution, and the modesty of the author are commended
for imitation. Those who have been subjected to Mr.
Simon’s homily cannot but suffer disenchantment when
they come face to face with the facts. Not after his
thirty years of asserted research could Jenner answer the
simple question, What is Cowpox? Incredible as it may
appear, the following was his deliverance in presence of
the doubts excited by the discussion of his original communication&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To what length pustulous diseases of the udder and nipples of
the Cow may extend, it is not in my power to determine; but
certain it is, that these parts of the animal are subject to some
variety of maladies of this nature; and as many of these eruptions
(probably all of them) are capable of giving a disease to the human
body, would it not be discreet for those engaged in this investigation
to suspend controversy and cavil until they can ascertain with
precision what <em>is</em> and what <em>is not</em> the genuine Cowpox? Until
experience has determined which is the <em>true</em> Cowpock, and which
is <em>spurious</em>, we view our object through a mist. (P. 73.)</p></div>

<p>Consider this declaration after thirty years of incessant
thought, observation and experiment! The Masterpiece
of Medical Induction with the essential fact undetermined!
The discovery undiscovered! And the reputed
discoverer sitting ready to appropriate any praise or
profit from the execution by others of his proper business!
Was there ever such an exhibition of self-satisfied
futility?</p>

<p>Among the gossip adduced to show that the country
folk called eruptions Cowpox that were not Cowpox, we
learn that the affection induced by Horsegrease was thus
designated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the similarity of symptoms, both constitutional and local,
between the Cowpox and the disease received from the morbid
matter generated by a Horse, the common people in this neighbourhood,
by a strange perversion of terms, frequently call it the Cowpox.
(P. 95.)</p></div>

<p>Wherefore, he argued, many thus affected may fancy
themselves secure from Smallpox, supposing they have
suffered Cowpox, when they have undergone nothing
but Horsegrease; and in the event of incurring Smallpox,
would bring discredit on the virtue of true Cowpox.
How easy it was to confound the two diseases, he illustrated
from the case of William Morris, a servant, aged
32, who applied to him on 2nd April, 1798&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His symptoms and the sores on his hands were so exactly like
the Cowpox, that I pronounced he had taken the distemper from
milking Cows. He assured me he had not milked a Cow for more
than half a year, and that his master’s Cows had nothing the
matter with them. I then asked him if his master had a Greasy
Horse, which he answered in the affirmative; and further said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that he had constantly dressed him twice a day for the last three
weeks or more, and remarked that the smell of his hands was
much like that of the Horse’s heels. (P. 97.)</p></div>

<p>Thus Horsegrease sores so simulated those of Cowpox,
or of Horsegrease Cowpox, as to be indistinguishable
from them. At this time it was Jenner’s opinion that
Horsegrease, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, afforded no protection from Smallpox:
it had to pass through the Cow to acquire its
sovereign efficacy. The opinion is noteworthy in view
of its absolute surrender at a later period, when the
virus from the Horse’s heel came to be described by
him as “the true and genuine life preserving fluid,” and
was used by him for inoculation without any reference
to the Cow.</p>

<p>One of the aims of <cite>Further Observations</cite> was “to
enforce the precaution of subduing the inoculated pustule
as soon as it had sufficiently produced its effect on the
constitution.” True Cowpox, according to Jenner, was
a serious affection. “The sores ate into the flesh.”
(P. 77.) They were capable of producing violent effects.
They were attended with erysipelas. “They closely
resembled Smallpox of the confluent sort.” (P. 111.)
To prolong such suffering he considered useless, for the
virus conferred its protective influence on the constitution
as soon as received&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The symptoms which (as in the accidental Cowpox) affect the
patient with severity, are entirely secondary, excited by the irritating
processes of inflammation and ulceration; and it appears to me
this singular virus possesses an irritating quality of a peculiar kind;
but as a single Cowpox pustule is all that is necessary to render the
variolous virus ineffectual, and as we possess the means of allaying
the irritation, should any arise, it becomes of little or no consequence.
(P. 110.)</p></div>

<p>The means for allaying the irritation were mercurial
ointment, acetate of lead, caustic potash, or any suitable
escharotic&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the pustule has duly exerted its influence, I should prefer
the destroying it quickly and effectually to any other mode. The
term caustic to a tender ear (and I conceive none will feel more
interested in this Inquiry than the anxious guardians of a nursery)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
may sound harsh and unpleasing, but every solicitude that may
arise on this account will no longer exist when it is understood that
the pustule in a state fit to be acted upon is then quite superficial,
and that it does not occupy the space of a silver penny. (P. 104.)</p>

<p>I would not, however, recommend any application to subdue the
action of the pustule until convincing proofs had appeared of the
patient having felt its effects for at least twelve hours. No harm
indeed could ensue were a longer period to elapse before the
application was made use of. In short, the pustule should be
suffered to have as full an effect as it could, consistently with the
state of the arm. (P. 109.)</p></div>

<p>Horsegrease annoyed Pearson&mdash;it was like to damn the
whole thing; and this treatment of the Cowpox pustule
was scarcely less objectionable to him and to Woodville.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
It gave the public, they thought, a sense of the virulence
of Cowpox that was wholly unwarrantable; and they
did not stay to consider whether what Jenner called Cowpox
in Gloucestershire and what they called Cowpox in
London were the same virus. Jenner’s virus was Horsegrease
Cowpox; Pearson and Woodville’s was Cowpox;
and such being the case, the diversity of symptoms might
have been accounted for. Anyhow, the difference between
Jenner and Pearson and Woodville, as to a detail
so elementary, shows in what an unfinished condition
the Cowpox prescription was shot upon the world, and
affords a curious commentary on the Masterpiece of
Medical Induction, the fruit of thirty years of incessant
thought, observation and experiment. At the same
time we have to do Jenner the justice of allowing that
at this date, 1799, he made no pretence to a finished
Masterpiece, but ingenuously ascribed the prevalent uncertainty
to “the present early stage of the Cowpox
Inquiry; for early,” he wrote, “it must be deemed.”
(P. 115.) Early it was: not a point firmly determined:
the reverse of what might have been expected after thirty
years of incessant thought, observation and experiment.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dr. Pearson was the chief actor in the formation of&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<em>The Institution<br />
for the Inoculation of the Vaccine Pock,<br />
Warwick Street, Charing Cross.</em><br />
<span class="fs90"><em>Founded 2nd December, 1799.</em></span><br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">In April, 1801, the Institution was removed to a more
commodious house, 5 Golden Square. It was the first
establishment of the kind in the world. In the conspectus
of the Institution it was stated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of above 4000 persons who have had the inoculated Cowpock one
only has died. There is, however, good ground for believing that
the proportional mortality will be even less than here stated.</p>

<p>Not a single well-attested instance has been produced among
more than 2000 inoculated with Cowpock, and subsequently with
Smallpox, of the Smallpox being taken, although many were
exposed to the infectious effluvia of that disease. Traditionally the
fact is established from time immemorial that after Cowpox there
is no Smallpox.</p>

<p>It may be fairly affirmed, that the inoculated Cowpock is
generally a much slighter disease than the inoculated Smallpox;
and that the proportion of severe cases in the latter is to the former
as at least ten to one.</p>

<p>It does not appear the genuine Vaccine Pock can be propagated
like the Smallpox by effluvia from persons labouring under it.
Hence if the Vaccine Inoculation should be universally instituted
in place of the Smallpox, it is reasonable to conclude, that this
most loathsome and fatal malady will be extinguished; and, like
the Sweating-Sickness, the Plague, certain forms of leprosy, etc.,
be known in this country only by name.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the Vaccine Poison, like that of the
Smallpox, can be conveyed so as to produce the disease indirectly
from diseased persons, by adhering to clothes, furniture, bedding,
letters, etc. Hence no danger of its propagation in these channels
is to be apprehended from the universal practice of the inoculation
of the Cowpock.</p>

<p>It has been found that a person, whose constitution has distinctly
undergone the Vaccine Disease, is in future insusceptible of the
same disorder. [<em>Thus re-vaccination was treated as impossible.</em>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Experience shows, that there is no reason to apprehend the
smallest chance of deformities of the skin from the Vaccine
Inoculation.</p>

<p>The extensive practice of the Vaccine Inoculation in the present
year, and the accounts of the disease in the casual way do not
show that any other disease will be excited subsequently.</p>

<p>A further considerable public benefit expected is, that a stock of
efficacious Vaccine Matter, <em>free from contamination by the Smallpox</em>,
will by this Institution be preserved for the use of the public.</p></div>

<p>These statements are interesting as showing how early
the rollicking tunes were set to which at this day we
are expected to dance. The last paragraph is noteworthy
as a confession under Pearson’s hand that vaccine poison
had got confused with variolous, and that the mistake
would henceforth be avoided. Jenner maliciously and
persistently used this mishap, for which Woodville was
responsible, to discredit Pearson and magnify his own
pretensions; but, as Pearson observed, neither Jenner
nor any one else knew that it was possible to have cowpox
and smallpox simultaneously. The mistake was made,
however; and, as is the function of mistakes, knowledge
was enlarged. Pearson’s behaviour in the matter was as
creditable to him as Jenner’s was otherwise.</p>

<p>The Vaccine Pock Institution was organised with a
staff of physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries of the
highest London respectability; and as it was desired to
have the benefit of Jenner’s name (his active co-operation,
as a resident in Gloucestershire, being out of the question)
Pearson wrote to him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>10th December, 1799</em>.</p>

<p>We have made some progress in the institution of a charity for
inoculating the Vaccine Pock. I do not know that I can confer
any honour on you by proposing you (if I am able) to the directors
of our establishment, nor do I well know what to propose to you.
It occurs to me that it might not be disagreeable to you to be an
extra corresponding physician.</p>

<p>No expense will be attached to your situation except a guinea a
year as a subscriber; and indeed I think you ought to be exempt
from that, as you cannot send any patients: but you may depute
some proxy in town.</p>

<p>I confess I was surprised that you neither called nor sent for me
for the last <em>two</em> months you were in town. However, if it was
because you were too much occupied, I certainly excuse you.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The invitation was given stiffly, from duty more than
inclination. Pearson knew very well why Jenner, furious
with jealousy, had kept away from him; and he was thus
answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, <em>17th December, 1799</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your letter of the 10th instant, and confess I
felt surprised at the information it conveys.</p>

<p>It appears to me somewhat extraordinary that an institution
formed upon so large a scale, and that has for its object the inoculation
of the Cowpox, should have been set on foot and almost completely
organised without my receiving the most distant intimation
of it. The institution itself cannot, of course, but be highly flattering
to me, as I am thereby convinced that the importance of the
fact I imparted is acknowledged by men of the first abilities. But
at the same time allow me to observe that if the Vaccine Inoculation,
from unguarded conduct, should sink into disrepute (and you
must admit, Sir, that in more than one instance has its reputation
suffered) I alone must bear the odium. To you, or any other of
the gentlemen whose names you mention as filling up the medical
departments, it cannot possibly attach.</p>

<p>At the present crisis I feel so sensibly the importance of the
business that I shall certainly take an early opportunity of being
in London. For the present I must beg leave to decline the <em>honour</em>
intended me.&mdash;I remain, Sir, your obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">E. Jenner</span>.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Pearson’s reply to this absurd and thoroughly Jennerian
letter does not appear. He might have thanked Jenner
for having drawn his attention to cowpox, and have
proceeded to point out that beyond that service he and
his friends owed him nothing, nor in anywise admitted
his guardianship. Their practice was at complete variance
with his teaching. He had prescribed horsegrease cowpox
in which they had no faith, having tried to produce it in
vain. On the other hand, they were operating with cowpox
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, which he had condemned as useless, being
attended with no erysipelas or constitutional effect; and
that working with this condemned cowpox, they found
themselves producing a much milder disease, and were
under no necessity of following his advice and destroying
the pustule formed at the point of inoculation with
escharotics; adding, that if they had been bound to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
horsegrease and caustics, they would have made no
progress with the public whatever.</p>

<p>Vaccine Inoculation might be good for mankind, but
it was to be something better for Edward Jenner. There
was not the least reason, outside his jealousy and rapacity,
why he should not have congratulated Pearson on his
enterprise and promised his assistance. As to claiming
the guardianship of Vaccine Inoculation, it was preposterous:
it had passed wholly beyond his control. It was
Pearson’s complaint that Jenner never did anything useful
after the publication of <cite>The Inquiry</cite>. He left to others
the discovery of virus, and the labour and responsibility
of experimenting, and only appeared on the scene when
there was some disaster whereat he could play the part of
superior person, whilst insisting that all supposed improvements
and successes should be assigned to his credit.</p>

<p>Jenner is all-in-all in the vaccinators’ hagiology, but
he holds the place at the cost of justice to Pearson and
Woodville. To prove that I am not making a fanciful
assertion, let me cite unprejudiced contemporary evidence.
Dr. Paterson of Montrose in a communication to the
<cite>Medical and Physical Journal</cite>, dated 25th May, 1801,
observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While we are irresistibly led to join the wondering, the grateful
throng, in paying the just tribute of applause to Dr. Jenner, the
immortal discoverer, we must, at the same time, confess how much
we are indebted to the ingenious and benevolent Dr. Pearson for
bringing, in such a handsome manner as he did, the business
before the public; thereby exciting, all at once, a universal, an
unparalleled quest of investigation, and furnishing, by innumerable
and satisfactory experiments, a complete confirmation of the noble
discovery.</p></div>

<p>Here, we may observe afresh, that Pearson did not
confirm Jenner’s “noble discovery.” On the contrary,
his use of cowpox was at distinct variance with Jenner’s
prescription of horsegrease cowpox, and with his condemnation
of cowpox. Jenner, as we shall see, followed
Pearson: Pearson did nothing to confirm Jenner.</p>

<p>Woodville lent his powerful influence as head of the
Smallpox Hospital to establish the New Inoculation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
He put Jenner’s prescription to the test with perfect
sincerity and admirable courage, suffering himself to be
thrice inoculated with horsegrease in order to come at the
truth;<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and only resorted to cowpox when he found horsegrease
cowpox unattainable. Mr. Anthony Highmore,
surgeon, speaking over Woodville’s grave in 1805, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who that have felt the benefits of Vaccination will not teach
their children, and their children’s children, to bless the name of
Woodville when they bless the name of Jenner.</p></div>

<p>Yet Pearson and Woodville, who made the New Inoculation
practical and practicable, were pursued by Jenner
with implacable animosity, stigmatising their mishaps
and appropriating their apparent successes.</p>

<p>To publish a pamphlet for the detraction of Woodville,
and if possible to upset Pearson’s Vaccine Pock Institution,
Jenner left Berkeley for London on 28th January,
1800, taking Bath on his way, where also a Vaccine
Pock Institution was in progress.</p>

<p>Early in 1800 appeared <cite>A Continuation of Facts and
Observations relative to the Variolæ Vaccinæ</cite>&mdash;a quarto of
40 pages, Jenner’s third pamphlet. Like its predecessor,
a trumpery collection of gossip, it was designed to manifest
his advantage over Woodville, who had inadvertently
confused cowpox with smallpox in his inoculations at the
Hospital.</p>

<p>First, Jenner expressed satisfaction over the interest
of Europe in Cowpox Inoculation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have the pleasure, too, of seeing that the feeble efforts of a few
individuals to depreciate the new practice are sinking fast into
contempt beneath the immense mass of evidence which has risen
up in support of it.</p></div>

<p>He then went on to describe the accumulating mass
of evidence&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upwards of six thousand persons have now been inoculated with
the virus of Cowpox, and the far greater part of them have since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
been inoculated with that of Smallpox, and exposed to its infection
in every rational way that could be devised, without effect.</p></div>

<p>“True,” Pearson might have observed, “but who inoculated
the vast majority of the six thousand? Nor were
they inoculated with the horsegrease cowpox you prescribed,
but with the cowpox you condemned.”</p>

<p>The introductory reference to Woodville revealed Jenner’s
disposition and tactics&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was very improbable that the investigation of a disease so
analogous to the Smallpox should go forward without engaging the
attention of the Physician of the Smallpox Hospital in London.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Dr. Woodville, who fills that department with so
much respectability, took an early opportunity of instituting an
inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox. This inquiry was begun in
the early part of 1799, and in May, Dr. Woodville published the
result, which differs essentially from mine in a point of much
importance. It appears that three-fifths of the patients inoculated
were affected with eruptions, for the most part so perfectly resembling
the Smallpox, as not to be distinguished from them. On
this subject it is necessary that I should make some comments.</p></div>

<p>Woodville, whose experiments were as a hundred to
one of his patronising critic, and informed with purpose
too, must have received this languid commendation of
his country acquaintance with some surprise, if not with
fierier sentiment. Jenner as an investigator was never
of much account. Of what constitutes scientific demonstration,
he had little perception. Incapable and indolent,
he nevertheless was ambitious, and had the craft to
appropriate the research of others, and with assurance so
ineffable that even the plundered fell under the persuasion
that what he took was somehow his own. For example,
the occurrence of smallpox and cowpox simultaneously
in Woodville’s practice, which he had not foreseen, nor
could any foresee, he first used as a pretext for lofty
reprehension toward Woodville, and then converted into
evidence of his own prescience, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In my first publication I expressed an opinion that the Smallpox
and the Cowpox were the same disease under different modifications.
In this opinion, Dr. Woodville has concurred. The axiom of the
immortal Hunter, that two diseased actions cannot take place at
the same time in one and the same part, will not be injured by the
admission of this theory.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark the adroit oblivion and the adroit attachment.
It was horsegrease that he assumed to be the origin of
smallpox through cowpox; and the cowpox used by
Woodville was Jenner’s condemned cowpox, underived
from the horse; yet the inconvenient was passed over,
and the convenient assumed!</p>

<p>Possibly cowpox and smallpox are forms of the same
disease: possibly they are not: possibly all diseases are
forms of one disease: possibly they are not: but whatever
the fact, Jenner had not an iota of evidence to adduce for
his conjecture that grease in horses, and pox from that
grease in cows, was a modification of smallpox in men.</p>

<p>As we review these early days of the New Inoculation,
nothing so stirs regret as what appears to have been the
wilful shutting of men’s eyes to facts&mdash;to notorious facts.
It was well known in Gloucestershire, that whilst the
vulgar supposed that cowpox prevented smallpox, it did
not do so. Indeed, it was under stress of this knowledge
that Jenner rejected cowpox <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> for horsegrease cowpox.
In the <cite>Gloucester Journal</cite> of 9th May, 1799, Mr.
C. Cooke wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I not only very much doubt that the Cowpox is a permanent
preventive of Smallpox, but I am confirmed in this opinion by
occurrences in my own practice, by conversing with many medical
men on the subject, and by Dr. Beddoes, who writes, “I have a
case where the Smallpox was taken after the Cowpox had been
twice gone through.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p></div>

<p>Yet in presence of such testimonies, which were neither
examined nor exploded, Jenner prophesied in this strain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some there are who suppose the security from the Smallpox
obtained through the Cowpox will be of a temporary nature. This
supposition is refuted, not only by analogy with respect to diseases
of a similar nature, but by incontrovertible facts, which appear in
great numbers against it. A person had the Cowpox 53 years
before the Smallpox was tried upon him, and as he completely
resisted it, I conceive every reasonable mind must be satisfied that
he was secure from the disease during the intervening time.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the evidence that he thought should satisfy
every reasonable mind! How did he know that the said
person had cowpox 53 years before, or had the right sort
of cowpox, and in the right way? Inoculation with smallpox
was continually unsuccessful (without reference to
cowpox as cause of failure) and especially among elderly
folk. When, however, there is a disposition to believe,
the most indifferent reasons serve for conviction.</p>

<p>Cowpox and Smallpox, said Jenner, were modifications
of the same disease; and Smallpox, whether contracted or
inoculated, was a well-known excitant of scrofula; and
Jenner was inclined to consider it probable that “the
general introduction of the Smallpox into Europe had
been among the most conducive means in exciting that
formidable foe to health.” Then, it might be said, Cowpox
as a modification of Smallpox must be liable to the
like objection. “Not at all!” protested the smooth-spoken
adventurer. “The diseases are the same, but unlike in
the excitation of scrofula”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having attentively watched the effects of the Cowpox in this
respect, I am happy in being able to declare, that the disease does
not appear to have the least tendency to produce this destructive
malady.</p></div>

<p>Considering his limited experience, the asseveration as
to the non-excitation of scrofula was sheer quackery, and
of a piece with the wilder assurance that follows. In
1798 he had set forth cowpox as a useful alternative to
smallpox for inoculation; but in 1800 the claim was
thus magnified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When scrutiny has taken place, not only among ourselves, but
in the first professional circles in Europe, and when it has been
uniformly found in such abundant instances&mdash;</p>

<p><em>That the Human Frame when once it has felt the influence of
the genuine Cowpox is never afterwards, at any period of its
existence, assailable by the Smallpox</em>,</p>

<p>May I not with perfect confidence congratulate my country and
society at large on their beholding in the mild form of the Cowpox,
an antidote that is capable of extirpating from the earth a disease
which is every hour devouring its victims; a disease that has ever
been considered as the severest scourge of the human race!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discuss these wild words&mdash;it is
sufficient to record them as evidence of what it was
possible to assert in the year 1800&mdash;and assert, too,
whilst as yet the Cowpox that was to work the miracle
was one thing in the hands of Jenner, and another in
those of Pearson and Woodville!</p>

<p>The pamphlet published, Jenner’s other business in
London was to undermine the institution for Vaccine Pock
Inoculation. He went about insinuating and protesting
that its founders and officers neither knew what was true
Variolæ Vaccinæ, nor how to use it; that not only were
they ignorant, but perverse; and that the immeasurable
blessing he had been the means of conveying to mankind
would never be rightly enjoyed until there was an Institution
with Edward Jenner for its guide and director.</p>

<p>In playing this game Jenner had facilities and advantages.
No one, not Pearson himself, contested his position
as advertiser of the New Inoculation, and to the public
he was its representative. He had attempted nothing
and had no mishaps to account for: these attached to
Woodville and other credulous and active experimenters.</p>

<p>Moreover he had no awkward information to contend
with in those he addressed&mdash;they listened, were informed,
were convinced. Jenner’s conduct at this juncture, in
relation to Pearson and Woodville, has been stigmatised
as mean, thankless, despicable. These be hard words.
His tactics were the common tactics of men in whom
self-love is predominant, and we have not the strength
for the use of the appropriate epithets with the frequency
that experience requires.</p>

<p>The poor were the chief sufferers from smallpox, and
under the name of the poor Jenner advanced his project.
He drew up the following memorandum, which he submitted
to the Earl of Egremont, and circulated privately&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pfs80">PROPOSAL FOR A PUBLIC INSTITUTION FOR VACCINE INOCULATION.</p>

<p>Having now pursued the inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox
to so great an extent as to be able positively to declare that those
who have gone through this mild disease are rendered perfectly
secure from the contagion of the Smallpox; and being convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
from numberless instances that the occupations of the mechanic or
the labourer will meet with no interruption during its progress, and
the infected and uninfected may mingle together in the most
perfect safety, I conceive that an Institution for the Gratuitous
Inoculation of the lower classes of society in the Metropolis would
be attended with the most beneficial consequences, and that it
might be so constituted as to diffuse its benefits throughout every
part of the British Empire.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Edward Jenner.</span></p>

<p>London, 16th March, 1800.</p></div>

<p>Then followed a scheme of the Institution, including
“a Physician to be appointed to superintend the medical
department.”</p>

<p>Whether from Jenner’s practical inefficiency, or because
the time was not ripe, or because those who were more
actively interested in cowpox were satisfied with Pearson’s
Institution, the project lay in abeyance till 1803. He took
nothing ostensibly by his intrigue save the withdrawal
of the names of the Duke of York and Lord Egremont
from the patronage of the existing establishment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pearson continued to operate with unabated
energy, and his Institution became a recognised centre of
inquiry, advice, and supply. It was designed, as he
wrote, “1st, to be useful to the poor; but it had other
objects, to wit, 2ndly, to ascertain the laws of the new
poison for the extinction of smallpox; and 3rdly, to serve
as a public office for the supply of the world with virus
until supplies should become unnecessary.” One of the
most flattering applications was received by Pearson from
the French Consulate on 5th April, 1800. In a reply,
dated 12th May, signed by the staff of the Institution,
it was said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are not surprised that you have not yet found the disease
among the cows of France, it being on the whole a rare disease in
England; nor are we surprised at your want of success with the
matter sent to you, because from experience we know that it very
frequently fails, unless used immediately from the subject.</p>

<p>Vaccine matter may be conveyed in various ways: we have sent
it to you in three, namely, on threads, on lancets, and on glass.</p>

<p>If you try the matter sent on thirty patients immediately, we
think you cannot fail to excite the disease in some of them, and
then you will please to preserve the succession by inoculation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
we do in England, having had no fresh matter from the cow since
January and February of last year, 1799.</p></div>

<p>The Frenchmen failed again with this virus, but Dr.
Woodville soon after went to Paris, and effected what
was desired.</p>

<p>Cow-Pock Dispensaries were opened in various towns
throughout England, Bath and Manchester perhaps having
the lead; and an Address to the Poor was drawn up as a
common form to be issued from such Dispensaries. In a
copy of this Address, widely circulated in and around
Manchester in 1800, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The experience of several years has fully proved that inoculation
for the Cowpox is <em>a certain preservative</em> against the Smallpox;
and is, besides, so mild and safe a disorder, when compared with
the inoculated Smallpox, that it has been generally introduced
among the better informed and more wealthy inhabitants, both
of this kingdom and of various parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Inoculation for the Cowpox has been practised for several years
[<em>less than three</em>] with constant success, in various parts of the
Kingdom.</p>

<p>It has never failed to prevent the infection of the natural
Smallpox.</p>

<p>It may be communicated with safety to persons of every age and
sex, and at all times and seasons of the year, with equal advantage.</p>

<p>It does not produce eruptions, which scar and disfigure the face;
and it is seldom, if ever, attended with any other marks of the
disease than what appear on the arms from inoculation.</p>

<p>So far from proving hurtful, delicate and sickly children are
often improved in health by having passed through this complaint.</p>

<p>Scarcely any remedies or attendance are required for the Cowpox,
nor is there any necessity for a course of physic before or after the
inoculation.</p>

<p>The prejudices of the poor against inoculation for the Smallpox,
by which thousands of lives have been annually saved,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> have been
often lamented; but if they suffer unjust prejudices to prevent their
laying hold of the advantages now offered to them by the inoculation
of the Cowpox, they will neglect the performance of a duty they
owe to themselves, to their families, and to society at large. For
surely it is little less than criminal to expose their helpless children
to the attack of so terrible and fatal a malady as Smallpox when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
may be readily avoided by the inoculation of so mild, simple, and
safe a disease as that of the Cowpox.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;All poor persons, whose affection for their families leads
them to embrace this favourable opportunity, may have their
children inoculated for the Cowpox at the Hospital and Dispensaries
every day in the week (Sunday excepted) throughout the
year. No time ought to be lost by the poor in freeing their
families from the apprehension of the Smallpox, <em>which daily
increases in frequency and malignity throughout this town</em>.</p></div>

<p>This manifesto is an illustration of the unscrupulous and
unwarrantable assertions with which the New Inoculation
was introduced to the world. There is no question that
many who were active in circulating these mendacities
did so honestly, justified, as they thought, by medical
authority. What is marvellous is the survival of the
primitive fictions to the present day. It would seem that
when the human mind acquires a certain <em>set</em>, something
like a surgical operation is requisite to reverse it.</p>

<p>We shall now see how the New Inoculation obtained
this sudden popularity&mdash;a popularity so sudden that
opposition had not time to organise itself. There were
protests, and some raillery. In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>
for August, 1799, we find a correspondent saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a plan to mitigate Smallpox in the human species by
passing it through a Cow. Now as everyone is not in possession
of a Cow, I propose to pass it through animals that most people
possess. I mean Cats; and I shall call it the Catpox. When my
plan is matured, the ingenious shall hear further concerning it.</p></div>

<p>And Pearson writing in 1802, when the success of
cowpox appeared secure, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How the new practice was sneered at by some: how it was reprobated
as a gross and mischievous imposition: how it was stigmatised
with the appellation of the Gloucestershire bubble: and
how the Inquirers were considered by many persons as fit
candidates for a certain asylum: to say nothing of the villainous
jests made on the occasion, are recent in our memory.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p></div>

<span class="chap-hdr">TRIUMPH OF THE NEW INOCULATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The House of Hanover has been reproached for indifference
to literature, science and art, but an exception
might be asserted on the score of variolous and vaccine
inoculation. It was Caroline, Princess of Wales, who in
1721 promoted Maitland’s experiments; and Jenner found
none so ready to hear and believe as George III. and his
family. His first convert was the Duke of Clarence, subsequently
William IV. The Duke’s surgeon happened
to be Francis Knight, who had lived in Wilts and Gloucestershire,
and was familiar with the country faith in cowpox,
and received Jenner’s communication with a ready
mind. In 1799 Knight was allowed to operate upon the
Duke’s children by Mrs. Jordan, and the fact was noised
abroad and passed to Jenner’s credit. Nor was the
Duke’s service limited to this example. He made Jenner’s
acquaintance, listened to his stories, and became his
active partizan. Then the Duke of York, commander-in-chief
of the army, was convinced, and enforced the new
practice to the full extent of his power. He, moreover,
acted as patron of the Vaccine Pock Institution until he
was persuaded that Pearson, its founder, was injurious to
Jenner. On 7th March, 1800, Jenner was presented to
George III. at St. James’s Palace, and delivered <cite>The
Inquiry</cite> bound in crimson to his majesty, who was
pleased to accept the dedication of the second edition.
On the 27th he had an interview with Queen Charlotte,
who conversed about the new specific with all the
curiosity of a grand-motherly quack. The Prince of
Wales followed suit; and Jenner found himself invested
with the full effulgence of the royal favour. It was a
magical success; for, consider, not two years had elapsed
since the publication of <cite>The Inquiry</cite>.</p>

<p>Jenner naturally became very popular. He wrote to
Mr. Shrapnel&mdash;“I have not yet made half my calls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
town, although I fag from eleven till four;” and, “Pray
tell Tierney how rapidly the Cowpox is marching over
the metropolis, and indeed through the whole island.
The death of three children under inoculation with smallpox
will probably give that practice the Brutus-stab.”</p>

<p>With little ability to make and maintain ground,
Jenner, like many feeble folk, had the faculty of converting
those he called his friends to his private advantage.
He did not subdue them by will, but by weakness.
Indeed, whoever chooses to observe will often have to
mark with amaze how stronger natures suffer their means
and energies to be appropriated by inferior organisms,
and used with the thanklessness of rightful possession.</p>

<p>John Ring was a remarkable instance of this sort of
possession. He was a surgeon in New Street, Hanover
Square, London. In 1799 he entered into correspondence
with Jenner, and his interest in cowpox and its advertiser
developed into an enthusiasm without qualification
by weariness or fear. Whatever Jenner asserted he
swore to; whatever charge was brought against the New
Inoculation he denied. He was ready for all comers
with such voluble and hearty vigour that his outrages on
propriety were laughed at and excused as “John Ring’s
way.” Among his earlier services was the preparation
of the Testimonial in favour of the New Inoculation
which he carried from house to house and obtained the
signature of nearly every London physician and surgeon
of distinction. The Testimonial was published in the
<cite>Medical Review</cite> and <cite>Medical Journal</cite> for July, 1800,
and was reprinted in the newspapers. It ran as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many unfounded reports have been circulated, which have a
tendency to prejudice the public against the Inoculation of the
Cowpox: we, the undersigned physicians and surgeons, think it
our duty to declare our opinion, that those persons who have had
the Cowpox are perfectly secure from the future infection of the
Smallpox, provided the infection has not been previously communicated.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>We also declare that the inoculated Cowpox is a much milder
and safer disease than the inoculated Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>The first signatures comprised thirty-two physicians
and forty surgeons, and the example being set, others
hastened from town and country to record their adhesion.
“I feel proud,” wrote Mr. Witham in sending his name,
“that my little bark may, with others more illustrious,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse14">Attendant sail,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Testimonial had great effect on the public mind:
to the majority it was irresistible. As Ring said, “It
confounded the enemies of the new practice”&mdash;adding in
his characteristic vernacular, “and it secured the triumph
of reason over the scruples of prejudice and ignorance,
and the base manœuvres of sordid and self-interested
men.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Thus early was it discovered that an opponent
of Vaccination was an ignoramus or a rascal. Ring’s easy
arrogance is concisely illustrated in this deliverance&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is no want of candour to affirm that those who are hostile to
Vaccine Inoculation, are total strangers to it; those who are
doubtful, are almost total strangers to it; and I defy the whole
world to produce one single instance of a person that has had any
experience of the disease, who is not a decided friend to the
practice.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner recognised his thorough-going supporter, and
used his loyalty to strike at Pearson and others who
failed to abide in like subservience. He wrote to a
foreign physician&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The discovery which I had the happiness to announce to the
world is much indebted to Mr. Ring’s ardent zeal and indefatigable
exertions for the rapid progress it has made; while some of those
<em>who vainly conceived themselves instrumental in promoting its
adoption</em> have in reality from <em>their ignorance and indiscretion</em>,
rather retarded than accelerated its progress.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Wonder is frequently expressed over the rapid conversion
of England and the world to Vaccination, but, as
I have before remarked, wonder is much reduced when
we set the circumstances clearly before us. Inoculation
with smallpox to avert smallpox was the practice of the
time, and it was not a universal practice simply because it
was troublesome and dangerous: everybody believed in
the saving rite; and where evaded it was as onerous and
perilous duties are always and everywhere evaded by the
indolent and cowardly. Inoculation with cowpox was
introduced to the public as a substitute for inoculation
with smallpox, equally efficient or more efficient, and
neither troublesome nor dangerous. Thus easy and
seductive was the transition from the one practice to the
other. Jenner had no serious battle to fight: the contest
was decided in the years during which inoculation
with smallpox struggled for prevalence. The warfare
that subsequently cost him so much irritation was conducted
by the conservatives of Inoculation, as experience
revealed the inefficiency and mischiefs of Vaccination.
Resistance such as is now offered to Vaccination on
physiological grounds there was none, so far as I can discover.
It had apparently occurred to no one that smallpox
was a consequence of the transgression of the laws
of health, and was preventible by submission to those
laws. It was imagined that the disease came by the will
of God, or the devil, or by force of fate, and that to dodge
it by medical craft was the utmost that was practicable.
Unless we bear in mind these conditions of the public
intelligence, we shall misapprehend the demeanour of the
people who so cordially welcomed Jenner’s advertisement.
It is always a mistake to criticise the conduct of an
earlier generation by the light of a later. We turn
history to ill account when we use it to nourish our self-complacency;
for the probability is that had we lived
with our forefathers, we should have done exactly as
they did.</p>

<p>Some will ask, How did it ever come to pass that so
many doctors in 1800 signed Ring’s testimonial certifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that inoculation with cowpox was a sure and everlasting
protection from smallpox when they had not, and could
not have, any experience to warrant their assertion?
True, but they had an illusory experience by which they
were beguiled, namely, the Variolous Test. Hundreds
were inoculated with cowpox and subsequently with
smallpox, and were also exposed to smallpox contagion,
and as the disease did not take, it was concluded it
could never take, and that the subjects of the operation
were fortified for ever. The fallacy is now manifest, but
it was by no means manifest in 1800, and all manner of
men received and propagated the fable with energetic
sincerity. It was once admitted that a tub full of water
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'did not everflow'">did not overflow</ins> when a fish was slipped into it, and
many explanations were current of the curious phenomenon
until a sceptical spirit suggested that the experiment
be tried. A like spirit might have suggested that
it was expedient to wait and see whether cowpox was
indeed a perpetual defence against smallpox, inasmuch
as nature had an awkward habit of confuting prognostications
apparently irrefragable.</p>

<p>The ease with which it was asserted cowpox inoculation
could be performed, coupled with its harmlessness, not
to say wholesomeness, and the absolute security it
afforded against smallpox, induced benevolent busybodies
to set up as vaccinators all over the country. What the
kindly quack delights in is something cheap and handy
with a touch of mystery and the promise of immeasurable
advantage&mdash;conditions which the new practice completely
fulfilled. The memoirs of the time, especially of
the Evangelical party, abound with instances in which
this good soul and that good soul had vaccinated so many
hundreds or thousands, delivering them from the peril
of an awful disease. Thus in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,
for December, 1800, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two respectable families near Manchester have within these
few months inoculated upwards of 800 of the neighbouring poor
from two months old to twenty years with uniform success.
Twenty of them were subjected to the variolous test, and all were
found proof against the disease.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>And John Ring relates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Jenner lately met in a large party of fashion a lady of
Portman Square, who, with another lady, has inoculated 1300 in
the north of England. The rural swain, when he receives the
blessing of Jenner’s discovery from such a fair hand, must conclude
that the Goddess of Health has adopted the practice.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></div>

<p>Of course medical practitioners had little favour for
this sort of intrusion into their domain, but Jenner
encouraged and boasted himself in the domestic diffusion
of the discovery. By and by when disasters became
common it was found extremely convenient to ascribe
them to these unskilled operators; and ultimately vaccination
was resigned entirely to the legally qualified
practitioner, whose failures are rarely inquired into, and
when proclaimed are, as professional matter of course,
explicitly denied.</p>

<p>Jenner after six months of lionising left London on
23rd June, 1800, and on his way home passed through
Oxford where he was introduced to Dr. Marlow, Vice-Chancellor
of the University, and other dignitaries, who
subscribed the following testimonial, drawn up by Sir
Christopher Pegge, Reader in Anatomy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, whose names are undersigned, are fully satisfied upon the
conviction of our own observation, that the Cowpox is not only an
infinitely milder disease than the Smallpox, but has the advantage
of not being contagious, and is an effectual remedy against the
Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>When a prophet in the country turns out a prophet in
London his country neighbours begin to believe in him;
and thus it was with Jenner. His metropolitan reputation
was reflected in Gloucestershire. Earl Berkeley
wrote to the Duke of Beaufort&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every father of a family owes the greatest obligation to Dr.
Jenner for preventing the dreadful effects of the smallpox.</p></div>

<p>And the sense of this obligation took shape in a
service of plate presented in 1801 and bearing this
inscription&mdash;</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">A DISHONOURABLE TRANSFORMATION.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Honour was abundant, but honour is windy fare, and
Jenner had an eye for something more substantial.
Among his papers we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While the vaccine discovery was progressive, the joy I felt at the
prospect before me of being the instrument destined to take away
from the world one of its greatest calamities, <em>blended with the fond
hope of enjoying independence</em> and domestic peace and happiness,
was often so excessive that, in pursuing my favourite subject among
the meadows, I have sometimes found myself in a kind of reverie.
It is pleasant to me to recollect that these reflections always ended
in devout acknowledgments to that Being from whom this and all
other mercies flow.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></div>

<p>But how was the fond hope of enjoying independence
to be realised? The question was discussed by Jenner
and his friends, and it was finally decided to apply to
the House of Commons for a reward. But in order to
go to Parliament it was necessary to have a good case,
and Jenner’s case was open to various objections. <cite>The
Inquiry</cite>, published in 1798, was by no means a manual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of practice. Its prescription was Horsegrease Cowpox;
but such Cowpox was neither producible nor accounted
tolerable. Cowpox that did not originate in Horsegrease,
Jenner had adjudged spurious; and yet such spurious
Cowpox had been adopted by Pearson and Woodville,
and under their influence had obtained extraordinary
popularity. It was therefore by no means improbable
that any claim for cash wherewith to enjoy independence
might be seriously contested. In this strait, what was
to be done? The question was a grave one, and called
for a heroic solution. Resolved therefore, that Horsegrease
Cowpox be dropped, and with it the use of
escharotics for the subjugation of the pustules produced
thereby. Absolute silence should thenceforth be his rule
as to Horsegrease. So much for the negative position:
the positive was more difficult. To claim Cowpox as his
own, with the modes of its exhibition devised by Pearson,
was an evolution full of hazard, but unless prepared to
surrender “the fond hope of enjoying independence,” it
must be effected. He had advantages. His name was
associated with the new practice: even Pearson had done
him homage: neither the medical profession nor the
public were likely to study the <cite>Inquiry</cite> critically, or to
trouble their heads over obscure details: Cowpox was to
them Cowpox: he had the world’s ear; and opposition
would be set down as the ordinary behaviour of envy
toward success. Anyhow the transformation must be
attempted: otherwise, farewell to dreams of financial
independence.</p>

<p>To initiate this transformation, Jenner came to London,
and in May, 1801, published a quarto pamphlet of twelve
pages, entitled <cite>The Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation</cite>.</p>

<p>First it was necessary to represent that his investigations
had extended over many years&mdash;a fact of which
there was no sign in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, the evidence indeed
being distinctly otherwise; and thus he shaped his
statement&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox commenced upwards
of twenty-five years ago. My attention to this singular disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was first excited by observing that among those whom in the
country I was frequently called upon to inoculate, many resisted
every effort to give them the Smallpox. These patients I found
had undergone a disease they called the Cowpox, contracted by
milking Cows affected with a peculiar eruption on their teats. On
inquiry, it appeared it had been known among the dairies from
time immemorial, and that a vague opinion prevailed that it was
a preventive of the Smallpox. This opinion I found was comparatively
new among them; for all the older farmers declared they
had no such idea in their early days&mdash;a circumstance that seemed
easily to be accounted for, from my knowing that the common
people were very rarely inoculated for the Smallpox till that practice
was rendered general by the improved method introduced by
the Suttons: so that the working people in the dairies were seldom
put to the test of the preventive powers of the Cowpox.</p></div>

<p>Jenner’s design in the foregoing statement was manifest.
It was to minimise the faith of the country folk,
and to represent that by his own perspicacity he had
discovered the virtue of Cowpox through his failures to
inoculate with Smallpox. The inquiries of Pearson and
others, however, showed conclusively that in many parts
of the south of England, in Ireland, and on the Continent
it was believed that to have suffered from Cowpox was
to be secure from Smallpox; and the belief was entertained
altogether independently of failures to inoculate
with Smallpox; just as a similar belief prevailed among
farriers as to the prophylaxy of Horsegrease. The faith
in Cowpox was neither vague, nor new, nor confined to
Jenner’s neighbourhood; and his assertion to the contrary
showed with what hardihood he had undertaken to construct
a case in his own favour.</p>

<p>In opposition to the rural faith, medical men maintained
that it was possible to have Smallpox after Cowpox;
and surgeons averred that they had successfully
inoculated many who had suffered Cowpox. Indeed it
was indubitable professional testimony to this effect that
compelled Jenner to forsake his first fancy for Cowpox,
and to report the true specific as Horsegrease Cowpox.
Having, however, to sacrifice that discovery, and revert
to the Cowpox he had discredited, a fresh manœuvre was
requisite; and thus was it performed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the course of the investigation I found that some of those <em>who
seemed to have undergone the Cowpox</em>, nevertheless, on inoculation
with the Smallpox, felt its influence just the same as if no disease
had been communicated to them by the Cow. This occurrence
led me to inquire among the medical practitioners in the country
around me, who all agreed in this sentiment, that the Cowpox was
not to be relied upon as a certain preventive of the Smallpox.
This for a while damped, but did not extinguish my ardour; for as
I proceeded I had the satisfaction to learn that the Cow was subject
to some varieties of spontaneous eruptions upon her teats, that
were all capable of communicating sores to the hands of the milkers,
and that whatever sore was derived from the animal was called in
the dairy the Cowpox. Thus I surmounted a great obstacle, and,
in consequence, was led to form a distinction between these diseases,
one of which only I have denominated the <em>true</em>, the others the
<em>spurious</em> Cowpox, as they possess no specific power over the constitution.</p></div>

<p>Here we have the trick before us at the very point of
transformation. He consulted with medical practitioners,
“who all agreed that Cowpox was not to be relied upon
as a certain preventive of Smallpox.” True. What did
he do next? He discovered that what Cowpox did not
prevent, the variety derived from Horsegrease did. Such
was the original revelation of 1798. In 1801 we have a
different story, and his quest a different issue. Not a
word about the discovery of the sure preventive in
Horsegrease Cowpox&mdash;not one word! Although his
ardour was damped by the medical evidence against
Cowpox, he yet prosecuted his inquiry; and to his satisfaction
ascertained that what the milkers called Cowpox
was not always Cowpox, but that any sores whatever
derived from the Cow were so designated. He therefore
was led to form a distinction between the diseases, and
to denominate one as <em>true</em> and the others as <em>spurious</em>
Cowpox.</p>

<p>Thus the Horse, the obnoxious Horse, was got rid of,
and the Cow represented as of herself yielding pox,
which pox was the Cowpox that Pearson and Woodville
(in contempt of Jenner’s 1798 revelation) had brought
into fashion; and which it had become all essential for
Jenner to claim as his own in order to realise his “fond
hope of enjoying independence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection the question occurs, Why should
“some varieties of spontaneous eruptions” have been
designated <em>spurious</em> Cowpox? Such eruptions were not
Cowpox in any sense. Why then spurious? That Cows
communicated a variety of sores to their milkers, described
by them in common as Cowpox, was an assertion
for which Jenner never adduced any evidence; which,
too, (as we shall see) at a later date he disowned as a
misapprehension. Nevertheless spurious Cowpox got
the New Inoculation over many difficulties. When
Smallpox, or any notable mischief, followed Cowpox it
was said, “Ah! the Cowpox must have been spurious;
for Smallpox, or any harm, is impossible after true Cowpox.”
People did not stay to inquire whether spurious
Cowpox (that was to say, matter “from a variety of
sores on the Cow,” according to Jenner’s second version)
could be propagated from arm-to-arm, even if taken
from the Cow by mistake. The illusory Variolous Test
and the Spurious Cowpox Dodge worked marvellously
for the public deception.</p>

<p>Another point Jenner tried to score at the cost of
Pearson and Woodville. When they began to inoculate
they found they had to ascertain at what period the
virus should be taken from the Cow, and from the arms
of the inoculated. Jenner afforded them no guidance.
Writing to John Ring, 1st July, 1801, he confessed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the early part of my inoculations I had not learned to discriminate
between the efficacy of the virus taken at an early and
at a late period of the pustule.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p></div>

<p>Where Jenner had not learned to discriminate, the line
became clear in the course of general practice; and Pearson
was especially explicit as to the right time for taking
virus; but to make good his claim to national consideration,
Jenner fancied it necessary to exhibit himself as
complete master of the art of Cowpox Inoculation, owing
nothing to others; and he therefore proceeded to appropriate
the fruit of the common medical experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
assigning it to a season when he alone was in the field.
Referring to his separation of true from spurious Cowpox,
he thus prosecuted his raid&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This impediment to my progress was not long removed before
another, of far greater magnitude in appearance, started up. There
were not wanting instances to prove that when the true Cowpox
broke out among the cattle at a dairy, the person who had milked
an infected animal, and had thereby gone through the disease in
common with others, was liable to receive the Smallpox afterwards.
This, like the former obstacle, gave a painful check to my fond and
aspiring hopes; but reflecting that the operations of Nature are
generally uniform, and that it was not probable the human constitution
(having undergone the Cowpox) should in some instances
be perfectly shielded from the Smallpox, and in many others remain
unprotected, I resumed my labours with redoubled ardour.
The result was fortunate; for I now discovered that the virus of
Cowpox was liable to undergo progressive changes from the same
cause precisely as that of Smallpox, and that when it was applied
to the human skin in its degenerated state, it would produce the
ulcerated effects in as great a degree as when it was not decomposed,
and sometimes far greater; but having lost its <em>specific properties</em>,
it was incapable of producing that change upon the human
frame which is requisite to render it insusceptible of the variolous
contagion: so that it became evident a person might milk a Cow
one day, and having caught the disease, <em>be for ever secure</em>; while
another person, milking the same Cow the next day, might feel
the influence of the virus in such a way as to produce a sore, or
sores, and, in consequence of this, might experience an indisposition
to a considerable extent; yet, as has been observed, the specific
quality being lost, the constitution would receive no peculiar impression....</p>

<p>This observation will fully explain the source of those errors
which have been committed by many inoculators of the Cowpox.
Conceiving the whole process to be extremely simple, as not to
admit of a mistake, they have been heedless about the state of the
Vaccine Virus; and finding it limpid, as part of it will be, even in
an advanced state of the pustule, they have felt an improper confidence,
and sometimes mistaken a spurious pustule for that which
possesses the perfect character.</p></div>

<p>No one apparently thought it worth while to expose
the fictitious character of these statements, invented by
Jenner to justify his pretensions and to baffle objections.
Any careful reader of the <cite>Inquiry</cite> of 1798, and the
<cite>Origin of Vaccine Inoculation</cite> of 1801, cannot fail to
perceive the radical inconsistency of the earlier and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
narratives, and how a few hasty experiments enveloped
in unverifiable conjecture and gossip, came to be magnified
into years of arduous research.</p>

<p>He wound up his statement with this flourish and
prediction&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The distrust and scepticism which naturally arose in the minds
of medical men, on my first announcing so unexpected a discovery,
has now nearly disappeared. Many hundreds of them from actual
experience, have given their attestations that the inoculated Cowpox
proves a perfect security against the Smallpox; and I shall
probably be within compass if I say thousands are ready to follow
their example; for the scope that this Inoculation has now taken
is immense. An hundred thousand persons, upon the smallest
computation, have been inoculated in these realms. [May, 1801.]
The numbers who have partaken of its benefits throughout Europe
and other parts of the globe are incalculable; and it now becomes
too manifest to admit of controversy, that the annihilation of the
Smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must
be the final result of this practice.</p></div>

<p>For the end designed&mdash;to establish and exalt a claim
with the purpose of exacting corresponding recompense,
the <cite>Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation</cite> was an adroitly
drawn document: its veracity is a different matter. A
just man, not to say a generous, would have had some
praise for Pearson, Woodville, and others to whom the
extension of the New Inoculation was due; but Jenner
was essentially a mean spirit; and for him to have stated
his case truly would have been to jeopardise “the fond
hope of enjoying independence.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Jenner was timid and indolent, and, though eager for
reward, required much prompting to use the means to
the end on which his heart was set. He wrote to Lord
Sherborne to speak for him to Prime Minister Addington;
but Sherborne replied, 23rd April, 1801, that he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
know Addington even by sight. He would however try
to see Mr. Pitt, adding for encouragement and direction&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If patriot Grattan gets £50,000 for his patriotism, the true patriot
Jenner deserves more: I am sure not less; and less would be
perfectly shabby to think of. I perfectly recollect Grattan’s business.
It was settled among his friends to propose £100,000 for
him, determining to ask enough; and fearing that sum would not
be granted, one of his particular friends was to get up afterwards
and propose £50,000, which was immediately granted, and he took
£47,500 for prompt payment.</p></div>

<p>Action had to be taken, and on 9th December, 1801,
Jenner went to London to prepare a petition to the
House of Commons and to canvass for support. Even at
the last moment, Wilberforce had to warn him, 24th
February, 1802, that no time was to be lost, or he would
lose his chance for the year. After prolonged consultation
with those accustomed to such business, the petition
was got ready, and on 17th March, 1802, it was presented
to the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The humble Petition of <span class="smcap">Edward Jenner</span>, Doctor of Physic,</p>

<p class="pad2 smcap">Sheweth,</p>

<p>That your Petitioner having discovered that a disease which
occasionally exists in a particular form among cattle, known by the
name of the Cowpox, admits of being inoculated on the human
frame with the most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with
the singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life the persons
so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of the Smallpox.</p>

<p>That your Petitioner after a most attentive and laborious investigation
of the subject, setting aside considerations of private and
personal advantage, and anxious to promote the safety and welfare
of his Countrymen and of Mankind in general, did not wish to
conceal the Discovery he so made of the mode of conducting this
new species of Inoculation, but immediately disclosed the whole to
the public; and by communication with medical men in all parts of
this Kingdom, and in Foreign Countries, sedulously endeavoured
to spread the knowledge of his discovery and the benefit of his
labours as widely as possible.</p>

<p>That in this latter respect the views and wishes of your Petitioner
have been completely fulfilled; for to his high gratification he has
to say that this Inoculation is in practice throughout a great proportion
of the civilised world, and has in particular been productive
of great advantage to these Kingdoms, in consequence of its being
introduced, under authority, into the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>That the said Inoculation hath already checked the progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the Smallpox, and from its nature must finally annihilate that
dreadful disorder.</p>

<p>That the series of experiments by which this discovery was
developed and completed have not only occupied a considerable
portion of your Petitioner’s life, and have not merely been a cause
of great expense and anxiety to him, but have so interrupted him
in the ordinary exercise of his profession as materially to abridge
its pecuniary advantages without their being counter balanced by
those derived from the new practice.</p>

<p class="negin1">Your Petitioner, therefore, with the full persuasion that he shall
meet with that attention and indulgence of which this Honourable
House may deem him worthy, humbly prays this
Honourable House to take the premises into consideration,
and to grant him such remuneration as to their wisdom shall
seem meet.</p></div>

<p>Patriot Grattan asked for £100,000, was awarded
£50,000, and took £47,500: “true patriot Jenner deserves
more,” said Lord Sherborne; but Jenner had not courage
for the demand. What, however, was undefined in cash
was made up for in pretension.</p>

<p>As we read Jenner’s petition we note (1) the Discovery;
(2) its Disclosure and Diffusion; (3) the Expense thereby
incurred; and (4) the Prophecies; and under these heads
it is to be observed&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;It was no discovery of Jenner’s that cowpox was
inoculable and preventive of smallpox. That was a rural
superstition. Nor, be it again repeated, did he ever
become responsible for that rural superstition. Recognising
its futility, he deliberately set it aside, and recommended
a disease of the horse, transmitted through the
cow, for inoculation. It was Pearson, who disliking
Jenner’s prescription, brought cowpox into vogue; whereon
Jenner, fearing that he might be cut out of the enterprise,
dropped his specific, adopted the cowpox he had
rejected, and claimed Pearson’s work as the development
of his own.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;That he disclosed his discovery was true, but it
was not the discovery set forth in the petition. Moreover
the merit of disclosure in such a case is measured by the
advantage of concealment; and what could Jenner have
taken by concealment? The conditions of successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
quackery were not present in the secret practice of
inoculation with horsegrease cowpox.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;That the discovery occupied a considerable portion
of Jenner’s life, and was attended with great expense and
loss of practice, is answered by reference to his <cite>Inquiry</cite>.
With what loss of time, loss of money, and loss of practice
could the series of cases therein set forth have been
attended? And after 1798, he confessed he was able to
achieve little further.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;As for the prophecies about the absolute security
afforded by cowpox with the final extermination of smallpox,
we may estimate the worth of such vapouring by
the asserted check at that time, 1801, administered to
the disease, when as yet an insignificant fraction of the
population had been subjected to the New Inoculation,
and a fraction, too, least likely to suffer from smallpox.</p>

<p>Petitions are petitions, and not designed for over-much
scrutiny. In them truth is rarely to be looked for otherwise
than warped to personal ends. The policy of a
petition is to claim in excess with a view to obtain a
larger concession. Jenner’s petition was a more than
usually flagrant instance of this policy, with the disadvantage
that much of its untruth passed into currency
as matter of fact.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addington</span> (afterwards Viscount
Sidmouth), informed the House that he had taken
the King’s pleasure on the contents of the petition, and
that his Majesty recommended it strongly to the consideration
of Parliament. It was referred to a committee,
of which Admiral Berkeley, a zealous believer in Jenner,
was appointed chairman. The points to which the committee
chiefly directed their inquiries were&mdash;</p>

<p>I.&mdash;The utility of the discovery itself.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;The right of the petitioner to the discovery.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;The sacrifices of the petitioner in making the
discovery.</p>

<p>As an investigation the work of the Committee was
illusory. The points were decided in the petitioner’s
favour from the outset. There was no opposition. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Moseley, Mr. Birch, and Dr. Rowley, who became active
opponents of the New Inoculation, were summoned, but
the matter was new to them; they had not had time to
collect evidence and formulate conclusions: a rite that
was to protect for a lifetime and to annihilate smallpox,
announced in 1798, was to be adjudicated upon in 1802!
On the other hand, Jenner’s friends were influential and
active, and used the opportunity to parade their whole
strength in his favour. The medical testimony especially
was unreserved and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">James Sims</span>, president of the London Medical
Society, laid before the Committee a unanimous resolution
of the Society in Jenner’s favour. He said he was
at first adverse to Vaccine Inoculation, but his confidence
in it was increasing every hour. It introduced no other
disease to the human frame, whilst it made an end of the
possibility of smallpox, a disease that proved fatal to one
in six of those it attacked. He had never heard of Cowpox
before the publication of <cite>The Inquiry</cite>, and regarded
the discovery therein communicated as the most useful
ever made in medicine. If Jenner had kept and traded
on his secret, he might have become the richest man in
the kingdom.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Gilbert Blane</span> related how the New Inoculation
had been introduced to the Navy. He had had the men
on board the <i>Kent</i>, man-of-war, inoculated with cowpox,
and then with smallpox, and not one took the latter
disease. Of every thousand deaths in the country, smallpox
was accountable for ninety-five. Taking London as
the standard, 45,000 must perish annually from smallpox
in the United Kingdom. As soon as the preventive discovered
by Jenner became universal that large mortality
would cease.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Lettsom</span>, a popular physician, a member of the
Society of Friends, and an enthusiastic supporter of
Jenner, said he had paid much attention to smallpox
statistics. Taking London and the out-parishes as containing
nearly 1,000,000 inhabitants, he calculated that
eight a day, or 3000 annually died of smallpox. Allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Great Britain and Ireland to have a population of
12,000,000, that would give a mortality of not less than
36,000 per annum from smallpox. He had reason to
conclude that about 60,000 persons had undergone the
New Inoculation up to date. He did not think that the
genuine cowpox when inoculated could ever prove fatal.
Had Jenner kept his remedy secret he might have derived
immense pecuniary profits from it, as did the Suttons by
their improved practice of variolous inoculation.</p>

<p>Asked whether he had known any inoculated with
smallpox subsequently contract smallpox, he replied that
he had two relatives inoculated who afterwards had
smallpox, and one of them died. He had recently attended
two families, in each of which a child inoculated was
laid up a year after the operation with smallpox.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Woodville</span>, forgiving Jenner’s evil treatment,
came, like a good Friend, to bear witness to the new
practice. He had learnt to prefer vaccine to variolous
inoculation at the Hospital. He had, up to January,
1802, operated with cowpox on 7,500 patients. About
half of them had been subjected to the Variolous Test
with satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bradley</span>, physician to the Westminster Hospital,
said he looked on Jenner as the author of Vaccine
Inoculation, and believed no medical man doubted it.
As accidental inoculation with cowpox was proved to
keep off smallpox for life, it was matter of course that
intentional inoculation would do so also. Not less than
2,000,000 of persons had received Vaccine Inoculation,
and he had never known an instance of any one dying
of it. One in 300 died of smallpox inoculation in
England, and not less than one in 150 throughout the
rest of Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Had Jenner
settled in London he might have made £10,000 per
annum for the first five years, and double that sum
afterwards.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Farquhar</span>, physician to the Prince of
Wales, had told Jenner that if he had come to London
and kept his secret, he would have ensured him £10,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a year. He had however divulged his secret and lost all
chance of emolument. His remedy was a permanent
security against smallpox, and had never proved fatal;
whilst variolous inoculation, performed in the best
manner, cost one life in three hundred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cline</span>, surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital, corroborated
the opinion that Jenner could have earned
£10,000 a year in London by means of his secret. As
smallpox was the most destructive of all diseases, its
suppression was the greatest discovery ever made in the
practice of physic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Griffiths</span>, surgeon to the Queen’s Household
and St. George’s Hospital, had inoculated upwards of 1500
persons with cowpox without any untoward symptoms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James Simpson</span>, surgeon to the Surrey Dispensary,
had inoculated between fifty and sixty without any
injury. Considered them perfectly secure from smallpox.
A child of nine months covered with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crusta lactea</i> resisted
all the usual remedies, but on the tenth day after
he had inoculated it with cowpox, the crust began to
disappear, and the twelfth day was entirely gone.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Marshall</span> related his experience as a vaccine
inoculator in the Navy and at Gibraltar, Malta,
Palermo, Naples, Rome and Genoa. Everywhere was
successful. Believed he had operated on 10,000, and
never witnessed any ill consequences whatever. On the
contrary, children in a weak state of health, after passing
through the vaccine infection, began to thrive and become
vigorous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Addington</span>, surgeon, had used Jenner’s
remedy since 1799 in eighty-one cases. One third of
these he had inoculated with smallpox, and subjected to
every method of infection he could devise, but found
them perfectly proof against the disease.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Skey</span>, physician to the Worcester Hospital, testified
that in the spring of 1801 smallpox was epidemic in
Worcester. He inoculated a number of children with
cowpox, and none of them took smallpox although constantly
exposed to contagion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>, physician to the Marylebone Dispensary,
had inoculated a patient with cowpox, and
afterwards with smallpox at twelve different times during
the past three years without effect. He had even
slept with a person in natural smallpox, who died, but
took no harm. When at Lord Lonsdale’s in the North
he had operated on upwards of a thousand, and had
completely satisfied himself, and all the medical practitioners
in that part of England, that cowpox was a mild
disease, hardly deserving the name of a disease. It was
not contagious; it never disfigured the person, never
produced blindness, nor excited other diseases. It was
equally safe whether during the period of pregnancy, or
the earliest infancy, or extreme old age.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baillie</span> then gave his influential judgment. He
thought cowpox an extremely mild disease, and when a
patient had properly undergone it, he was perfectly
secure from the future infection of smallpox: and
further, if Dr. Jenner had not chosen openly and honourably
to explain to the public all he knew upon the
subject, he might have acquired a considerable fortune.
In his opinion it was the most important discovery ever
made in medicine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">David Taylor</span>, surgeon of Wootton-under-Edge,
had inoculated about two thousand persons with cowpox
without a single failure, nor had he met with any ulcerations,
tumours, or other diseases following the operation.
He knew Jenner’s practice in Gloucestershire. It was in
a very populous neighbourhood where there was not
another physician within sixteen miles. He had surrendered
an income of £600 a year to devote himself to
the public service.</p>

<p>As a final specimen of this medical evidence I may
cite Mr. <span class="smcap">John Ring</span>, the petitioner’s henchman. He
considered Jenner the author of Vaccine Inoculation, a
discovery the most valuable and important ever made by
man. It was a perfect and permanent security against
smallpox. He had himself inoculated about 1200, of
whom a thousand had exposed themselves to smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
infection with impunity. There was no danger whatever
from the New Inoculation unless from ignorance and
neglect. One in every hundred inoculated with smallpox
in London died, owing to the unwholesome atmosphere
and the necessity of operating on children at an improper
age. If Jenner had kept his discovery to himself he
might have made £10,000 a year by it; for others had
got as much or more by the practice of physic.</p>

<p>This evidence, better than any secondary description,
will enable the reader to appreciate the prevalent furore
as it affected the leaders of the medical world. At the
same time it is to be borne in mind that the craze was
superficial. Any radical change in conviction or practice
is never accomplished thus easily or thus rapidly. The
medical men who bore witness for cowpox had been bred
to inoculation with smallpox, for which cowpox was
substituted. The change was essentially trivial. The
trouble, the danger, and the uncertainty of variolous
inoculation were generally recognised, and when cowpox
was recommended as a mild form of smallpox, it was not
difficult to appreciate the asserted advantage: for, as it
was argued, no one can have smallpox twice, and as the
mildest attack of smallpox is as prohibitive of a second
attack as the severest, therefore cowpox (which is smallpox
in mild form) must protect as effectually when
inoculated. With logic so admirable, it was in nowise
wonderful that so many were carried away; but unfortunately,
as so often happens, matter-of-fact did not
correspond to the admirable logic.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duke of Clarence</span> testified that he had availed
himself of Jenner’s discovery from the outset. His
children, his household and farm servants were all
protected. A postillion positively refused to be operated
on, and eighteen months after he caught smallpox in the
most virulent form. Children who had undergone cowpox
were constantly in the room where the lad lay and
suffered no harm.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Berkeley</span> had his son inoculated with
cowpox by Dr. Jenner at the age of six months. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
his maid-servants took smallpox and died, and the
effluvia during her illness was so offensive that his servants
had to move to another part of the house. To
test the reality of his son’s protection, he sent for Jenner,
and got him to inoculate the boy with pox from the
maid. The child was found to be proof, for the inoculation
had no effect&mdash;To illustrate the validity of the
Gloucestershire tradition, he related how a man of 72 in
his service had caught cowpox when a boy of 15 whilst
milking, and in consequence always reckoned himself
secure from smallpox, exposing himself to the disease
with complete indifference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Rous</span> gave similar evidence. His child had
been inoculated with cowpox at the age of three months,
and he was perfectly satisfied that he could never have
smallpox.</p>

<p>Then there were lay practitioners, of whom Jenner’s
nephew, the Rev. <span class="smcap">G. C. Jenner</span>, may be taken as an
example. He bore witness that he had inoculated 3000
with cowpox without a single unfavourable case, from
the earliest infancy to eighty years of age, and under
circumstances in which it would not be prudent to use
variolous virus; as, for example, children during teething
and women in every stage of pregnancy. Upwards of
two hundred of his patients had been afterwards inoculated
with smallpox matter, and an equal number
exposed to variolous effluvia, and in no instance did
smallpox ensue. He was satisfied that as soon as the
new practice became universal, smallpox would be annihilated.</p>

<p>An early date being wanted for “the discovery,”
<span class="smcap">Edward Gardner</span>, wine and spirit dealer, was brought
from Gloucester to affirm that he had known Jenner for
more than twenty-two years, and had been in the constant
habit of hearing his medical opinions and discoveries.
It was in the month of May, 1780, that Jenner
first informed him concerning the nature of cowpox as a
sure preventive of smallpox, and of the theory he had
formed on the subject; declaring his full and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
confidence that the virus might be continued in perpetuity
from one human being to another until smallpox was
extinguished.</p>

<p>It is needless to stigmatise Gardner’s testimony afresh.
It possibly had its foundation in Jenner discussing the
familiar rural faith in cowpox. Sir <span class="smcap">Everard Home</span>
mentioned to the Committee that Jenner had brought
a drawing to London in 1788 of Variolæ Vaccinæ as it
appeared on the finger of a milker, and had shown it to
John Hunter, who advised him to look further into the
matter; but it was not pretended that he spoke to
Hunter of the matured conviction revealed to Gardner
eight years before.</p>

<p>The Committee heard evidence as to the knowledge
and use of cowpox apart from Jenner, and their verdict
was given as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The disorder itself, and its specific property of securing against
Smallpox infection, <em>was not a discovery of Dr. Jenner’s</em>; for in
various parts of England, in Gloucestershire and Devonshire particularly,
there was an opinion of that sort current among the
common people employed in dairies, which the observations of the
inoculators for the Smallpox tended to confirm. It appears not
improbable that in some very rare instances this knowledge was
carried one step farther, and that the Cowpox was communicated
either by handling the teat, or by inoculation from the animal, for
the purpose and with the intention of securing against the danger
of Smallpox; but the practice of which Dr. Jenner asserts himself
to be the original Inventor is, the inoculation from one human
being to another, and the mode of transferring indefinitely, the
vaccine matter without any diminution of its specific power, to
which it does not appear that any person has ever alleged a title.</p></div>

<p>Thus the Committee disallowed Jenner’s claim, whilst
indicating the only colourable point of novelty, namely, the
transfer from arm to arm of virus. At the same time, it
should not be forgotten that inoculation from arm to arm
with “mild kinds of smallpox” was an existing practice,
and there was little merit to speak of in Jenner doing
the same thing with horse or cowpox.</p>

<p>There was no opposition&mdash;no devil’s advocate; but it
may be held that Dr. Pearson assumed that office. He
was heard with impatience, and afterwards delivered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
mind in <cite>An Examination</cite>, to which we shall presently
refer.</p>

<p>The Report to the House was brought up on the 2nd
of June, 1802, and was conclusive as to the utility of the
discovery. Indeed, the evidence on that head was only
cut short because it threatened to be interminable. The
judgment of the Committee reiterated the common persuasion&mdash;“As
soon as the New Inoculation becomes
universal, <em>it must absolutely extinguish</em> one of the most
destructive disorders by which the human race has been
visited.”</p>

<p>Admiral <span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, chairman of the Committee, commended
the Report to the House. He considered the
discovery as unquestionably the greatest ever made for
the preservation of the human species. <em>It was proved</em>
that in the United Kingdom 45,000 perished annually
from smallpox; but throughout the world what was the
desolation! Not a second struck but a victim was sacrificed
at the altar of that most horrible of diseases. He
should therefore move that a sum of not less than £10,000
be granted to the Petitioner, but if the House thought fit
to adopt any larger sum, he should hold himself free to
vote for it. Why, Dr. Jenner’s expenses in postage alone
had been from 25s. to 30s. a day!</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Mildmay</span> did not think £10,000 at all
adequate. Had Jenner kept his secret he might have
made at least £100,000. He moved that he should have
£20,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Windham</span> said the petitioner had surrendered his
discovery to his country, and was therefore entitled to
remuneration. The discovery had been the labour of
years and the fruit of extensive practice.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">James Sinclair Erskine</span> was assured that Jenner
had expended £6000 in the propagation of his discovery,
and if he had £10,000, he would be left with no more
than £4000. Besides, he had given up a practice of £600
a year to benefit his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> observed that the evidence showed that
40,000 men would be annually preserved to the State by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the New Inoculation. These would return £200,000 a year
to the Exchequer, and if the Petitioner had only a tithe
of that sum for one year, he was entitled to £20,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span> stated that Jenner had spent upwards
of twenty years in completing his discovery. He was no
adventurer seeking to push himself before the world. He
had already attained to great celebrity in his profession,
and had sacrificed his practice for the public good. In
every view he thought the larger sum ought to be
granted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Grey</span> thought £10,000 would be no more than an
indemnity for expenses. He hoped the House would vote
for £20,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Banks</span> said there was no question as to the utility
of the discovery. If he felt more niggardly than other
members, it was because his paramount duty consisted in
guarding the public purse. That purse was a large one,
but it was not to be dipped into at pleasure. The strength
of the country lay in economy and sound finance. He did
not see that a case had been made out for so large a sum
as £10,000. The discovery itself might be trusted to pay
its author. He always looked on a Report of a Committee
with jealousy, for it was controlled by the friends of the
Petitioner, and there was no one with sufficient motive
to provide the correctives required in the public
interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Addington</span>, Chancellor of the Exchequer, held
that the value of the discovery was without example, and
beyond calculation. So much, indeed, was not contested.
The Petitioner had received the highest reward in the
approbation, the unanimous approbation of the House;
an approbation richly deserved, since it was the result of
<em>the greatest discovery since the creation of man</em>. Whatever
money the House might see fit to vote on some future
occasion, his present duty was to recommend the smaller
sum of £10,000. In doing so, he admitted, he surrendered
his private inclination to his sense of public duty. He
had, however, the satisfaction in knowing that this discussion
had conferred on Dr. Jenner a reward that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
endure for ever, whilst the comfort of his family would
be amply ensured in the extension of practice that would
follow the approbation of the House.</p>

<p>The question was then put that the words £10,000 do
stand part of the resolution; when the Committee divided&mdash;Ayes
59, Noes 56, Majority 3.</p>

<p>The discussion in the House of Commons shows how
wide was the general craze. Facts and figures were
evolved at discretion and repeated indiscriminately. To
rave about Jenner, the saviour from smallpox, was the
mode. It was as if all had consented to go mad together.
Mr. Dunning, a surgeon, otherwise rational, broke into
prophetic fury&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

a Harvey; posterity will boast a Jenner!<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></div>

<p>Considering the value set on “the great discovery,” the
award of £10,000 was not excessive. In the <cite>Medical
Journal</cite> it stands recorded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">A few weeks after the award of £10,000 to Jenner by
the House of Commons, Dr. Pearson published <cite>An Examination</cite>
of the report of the committee. He did not
contest Jenner’s claim to consideration, but the ground
on which it was advanced, and on which it was conceded;
drawing attention to the manner in which the claims set
forth in Jenner’s petition had been reduced to “inoculation
from one human being to another,” whilst a new
claim was invented for him, “to wit, the mode of transferring,
indefinitely, the vaccine matter without any
diminution of its specific power.”</p>

<p>What Pearson held, and rightly held, was, that the
public acceptance of the New Inoculation was due to
Woodville and himself, and not to Jenner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Cowpock Inoculation (after Dr. Jenner’s book was published
in June, 1798, which contained seven or eight cases, the whole
result of his experience) was not practised by any person that I
know of, till January, 1799, neither Dr. Jenner, nor any person
that I could find being in possession of matter; but, in January,
1799, in consequence of a general inquiry, which I had instituted
immediately after Jenner’s publication, information was given of
the Cowpock Disease breaking out in two Cow-stables near London,
and from these sources Dr. Woodville and myself collected
matter, by which, in the course of three months, 300 persons (not
fewer, I think) were inoculated for the Cowpock in addition to the
seven or eight cases of Dr. Jenner, then the whole stock of facts of
Inoculation before the public. Besides carrying on the Inoculation
ourselves in this manner, we disseminated the matter throughout
the country, in particular to Dr. Jenner himself; and especially, I
within that time issued a printed letter, directed to upwards of two
hundred practitioners in different parts of the kingdom, containing
thread impregnated with the Cowpock matter.... By the close
of 1799 about 4000 persons had been inoculated by Dr. Woodville,
myself, and our correspondents.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Pearson also claimed to have cleared away difficulties
created by Jenner’s statements, some of which were most
prejudicial to the public acceptance of the New Inoculation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I published experiments of inoculating persons with the Cowpock
to show that <em>they could not take the Cowpock after the Smallpox</em>,
contrary to Dr. Jenner. Secondly, experiments to show that persons
could not take the Cowpock who had already gone through the Cowpock,
also contrary to Dr. Jenner.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Thirdly, many persons had at
this period made experiments to show that <em>the Cowpox did not
originate in the grease of Horses’ heels</em>, as Dr. Jenner had asserted.
In the spring of 1799, a second publication appeared from Dr. Jenner
recommending caustic or escharotics to the inoculated parts in
Cowpox, which we found wholly unnecessary in practice; and I
consider that the distinctive characters of the Cowpock were better
understood by some of us than by Dr. Jenner himself.</p></div>

<p>One can only say of these statements of Pearson as
against Jenner, that they are simple matters of fact,
impugn them whoso list. It is impossible to controvert
Pearson’s assertion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the whole of Jenner’s experience extended to seven or eight
cases, and a part only of these&mdash;namely, four&mdash;were from human
subject to human subject; and not until long after Dr. Woodville
and myself had published several hundred instances of vaccine
virus transmitted from arm to arm, had he any experiments to set
alongside ours.</p></div>

<p>They had to find out for themselves when to take virus
from the cow, how to preserve it when taken, how to
dress inoculated arms, when to take virus from the arm,
and, in short, to do everything that constitutes the difference
between a suggestion and an art.</p>

<p>Pearson, too, as we have seen, had a leading part in
the formation of the first Institution for the Inoculation
of the Vaccine Pock, with which Jenner had not only
nothing to do, but <em>would</em> have nothing to do: concerning
which wrote Pearson&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Vaccine Inoculation was next considerably established by
the Cowpock Institution, of which I was one of the founders, commencing
at the close of 1799; which Institution has been the principal
office for the supplying the world in general, and the Army
and Navy in particular, with matter; and where a regular register
is kept of each of the cases inoculated.</p></div>

<p>As to Jenner keeping the secret of Cowpox and making
a great fortune out of it, Pearson replied, first, that he had
not proved his remedy; second, that he would have had
to persuade the public to believe in him; and, third, that
too much was known about Cowpox to have made a
secret possible. Moreover, the assertion that he might
have earned £10,000 a year and a fortune of £150,000
was absurd&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such a fortune no one ever acquired by physic in this or any
other country&mdash;far exceeding the greatest ever known, those of Sir
Theodore Mayerne in the first half of the 17th century, and of the
still greater one of Dr. Ratcliffe in the early part of last century.</p></div>

<p>When it was further said, that experiments in Vaccine
Inoculation had occupied twenty years of Jenner’s life, that
they had cost him £6000, and that he had surrendered a
practice of £600 a year in the populous neighbourhood of
Berkeley for the public benefit&mdash;he would not trust himself
to characterise the allegations.</p>

<p>His own position, Pearson thus defined&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have admitted that Dr. Jenner first set on foot the inquiry into
the advantages of Vaccine Inoculation; but I apprehend that the
practice has been established almost entirely by other practitioners;
and that his new facts, or which I consider to be new, have been,
in my opinion, disproved by subsequent observers; and that in
consequence of those facts being disproved, together with the very
ample experiences of other persons, we owe the present extensive
practice of the Vaccine Inoculation.</p></div>

<p>Pearson further indicated on what conditions he would
have been satisfied to see Jenner rewarded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A much more dignified and more just ground of claim, and an
equally favourable one for remuneration, would have been in terms
denoting that the Petitioner had proposed a new kind of Inoculation,
and actually furnished some instances of the success of it,
founded upon facts; of which some were brought to light and use,
which heretofore had only been locally known to a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
number of persons; and others were discoveries of the Author:
further, that in consequence of considerable subsequent investigation,
by the Author and others, such a body of evidence had been
obtained, and such further facts had been discovered, as demonstrated
the advantages of the new practice.</p></div>

<p>Whilst willing that Jenner should be rewarded, for
Woodville and for himself, Pearson wanted nothing: he
simply maintained that the judgment of the House of
Commons Committee should have recognised the facts
of the situation. He observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have some authority for stating that the members of the Committee
<em>did not unanimously</em> think such exclusive claims were
just. I had some reason to expect that the representation of the
Committee in their Report would have been such as to have satisfied
the expectations, not exorbitant, of Dr. Woodville and myself;
such as would have cost the Petitioner nothing, <em>to wit</em>, a mere
acknowledgment of services. The most unqualified and exclusive
claims having been decreed, this bounty of course has been withheld,
either because it was judged to be not owing, or from some
other motive which I will not name; but it is fitting that I disclaim
any insinuation of unworthy motives actuating those with whom
judgment was invested.</p></div>

<p>Considering the injustice to which Pearson had been
subjected, and the provocation he had received, it is
impossible to refrain from admiration of the serene and
impartial temper in which he composed his <cite>Examination</cite>.
Had he sat as judge between Jenner and himself, he could
not have stated the case with greater accuracy and absence
of bias. He fell into no exaggeration; he indulged in no
sarcasm; he descended to no abuse. He set forth the
incidents of the New Inoculation with the imperial simplicity
and dignity of truth. Where others had gone
crazed, he preserved some degree of sanity. He held it
to be premature to proclaim the extinction of Smallpox,
or to say with Jenner that reports of failure and injury
from inoculated Cowpox were beneath contempt. It was
only time and experience that could warrant such absolute
assertion and prediction.</p>

<p>It is said that in hurricanes of panic or enthusiasm,
wise men go home and keep quiet until the sky clears,
resistance being folly. For immediate effect resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
may be folly, but the protest of truth is sometimes imperative,
whatever the disposition of the mob. Pearson
took little at the time by his <cite>Examination</cite>: it entered
into far too many details for general apprehension; and
it was convenient to account for his opposition as due
to jealousy and envy. Jenner attempted no reply, and
assumed profound disdain. His silence was judicious,
but it was not from disdain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this day it is easy to see that Pearson as against
Jenner played his part badly, failing to recognise his
proper advantage. Jenner’s prescription in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>
of 1798 was not Cowpox. It was Horsegrease Cowpox.
It was a disease of the horse inoculated on the cow.
Cowpox <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> he expressly rejected as useless, having no
specific effect on the human constitution. Pearson and
Woodville entertained Jenner’s prescription in good faith.
They tried to generate pox on the cow with grease from
the horse, but did not succeed. Reluctantly they abandoned
Jenner’s prescription, and resorted to Cowpox.</p>

<p>Whilst Pearson and Woodville were without prejudice
against Horsegrease Cowpox, it was otherwise with the
public. The origin of Cowpox in Horsegrease was voted
detestable, and had the origin been maintained, it is not
improbable that the New Inoculation would have proved
abortive.</p>

<p>This difficulty Pearson and Woodville, the chief promoters
of the New Inoculation, cleared away. They had
tried Horsegrease; they considered they had disproved
Jenner’s assertion concerning it; and they were able to
assure the public that they inoculated with Cowpox, and
nothing but Cowpox, and had no connection with Horsegrease
whatever. The public were satisfied; and Inoculation
with Cowpox became the rage, fashionable and
philanthropic.</p>

<p>What did Jenner do? Did he vindicate his prescription,
the fruit of thirty years of incessant thought,
observation and experiment? He did not. On the
contrary he dropped it. He said not another word about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it; and proceeded to claim Cowpox as employed by
Pearson and Woodville as his discovery. In his petition
to Parliament there was no mention of Horsegrease Cowpox;
but Cowpox, with “its beneficial effect of rendering
the persons inoculated therewith perfectly secure through
life from the infection of Smallpox,” was set forth as the
result of his most attentive and laborious investigation
at the sacrifice of time, money, and professional advancement.
We have to recollect that Jenner was inspired
with what he called “the fond hope of enjoying independence,”
and he was not slow to recognise, that if he
stood by Horsegrease Cowpox his “fond hope” would be
wrecked. The statement may seem incredible, but the
fact of the transformation is manifest at large to any one
who will take the trouble to compare Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>
of 1798 with his Petition to the House of Commons in
1802.</p>

<p>Pearson failed to arrest the imposture. He might
have said to Jenner, “Your discovery was not Cowpox:
that was well known to every dairymaid in your neighbourhood.
Your prescription was Horsegrease Cowpox.
You condemned Cowpox, which Cowpox has nevertheless
been brought into use by Woodville and me. Keep to
your Horsegrease Cowpox; make what you can of it;
and leave us alone.”</p>

<p>Had Pearson taken this course, he would have fixed
Jenner to his discovery, such as it was, and have clearly
defined and established his own and Woodville’s service
in rendering the New Inoculation practicable and popular.
But he failed to draw a firm line between Woodville and
himself and Jenner, and to insist that they were operating,
not only with a different pox, but with a form of
pox by him rejected as useless. Through this default, he
enabled Jenner to intrude into a province that was not
his own, and to reap where he had not sown, and gather
where he had not strawed. It is to be admitted that the
facts as stated were all involved in Pearson’s <cite>Examination</cite>,
but they were <em>involved</em>, and required picking out
and sharper definition to give them effect. Truth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
truth, but truth to have its rightful influence has to be
made plain. It is of little avail to have a good cause at
law if the means are wanting to place its goodness
manifest and paramount over contention to the contrary.</p>

<p>This, too, may be observed: Pearson was not in condition
to offer the manner of resistance specified. To have
turned Jenner’s flank, it would have been necessary to
discredit Cowpox; and Pearson was committed to Cowpox.
Jenner had been familiar from youth with the
dairymaids’ faith in Cowpox. Why then did he not
advertise its virtue? Because it had been proved to him
that the dairymaids’ confidence was illusory. His recommendation
of Horsegrease Cowpox attested his distrust
in Cowpox. If Pearson had asked himself, What induced
Jenner to set aside Cowpox for Horsegrease Cowpox?
the answer would have revealed to him a whole series of
facts to the discredit of that prophylaxy of which he and
Woodville had constituted themselves advocates. Thus,
fettered by his own prepossession, Pearson was unable to
deal effectually with Jenner without incurring a disenchantment
fatal to his own enterprise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we recognise that Jenner’s prescription was a
disease of the horse communicated to the cow, which
Pearson and Woodville set aside for Cowpox, the controversy
as to the originator of the use of Cowpox for
inoculation loses significance. We have to assert peremptorily
that Jenner had no claim to the use of Cowpox
whatever. It is true that he advanced the claim in his
<cite>Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation</cite> in 1801, and in his
Petition to Parliament in 1802; but those who refer to
his <cite>Inquiry</cite> of 1798 will require no further proof of his
mendacity. That his claim to the use of Cowpox was
entertained can only be ascribed to that indolence, ineptitude
and ignorance on the part of the world whereon
quacks presume and prosper.</p>

<p>It was Pearson and Woodville, I once more repeat,
who diffused and popularised Cowpox; and Pearson’s
inquiries left no doubt that the faith in Cowpox as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
preventive of Smallpox was widely entertained; and
that the substitution of Cowpox for Smallpox in inoculation
was a mere question of time and accident. Mr.
Downe of Bridport informed Pearson that a surgeon in
his neighbourhood suffered discredit in practice because
it was reported that he inoculated with Cowpox instead
of Smallpox; and the papers of Mr. Nash, surgeon, of
Shaftesbury proved that in 1781 he had the project of
Cowpox Inoculation distinctly before him. The evidence
of Benjamin Jesty, farmer of Downshay in the Isle of
Purbeck, has usually been taken as most conclusive in
relation to the immanence of the New Inoculation in the
common mind. Jesty was invited to London by the
conductors of the Original Vaccine Pock Institution, 44
Broad Street, Golden Square; and in August, 1805, they
had him with his wife and two sons under examination.
In their report<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We think it a matter of justice to Mr. Jesty, and beneficial to the
public, to attest, that among other facts he has afforded decisive
evidence of his having vaccinated his wife and two sons, Robert
and Benjamin, in the year 1774; who were thereby rendered
insusceptible of the Smallpox, as appears from the frequent exposure
of all three to that disorder during the course of 31 years, and from
the inoculation of the two sons for the Smallpox 15 years ago.</p></div>

<p>It is to be observed that insusceptibility to Smallpox
was by no means infrequent apart from Cowpox; and as
fear of Smallpox predisposes to attack, so, on the other
hand, confidence in security, whether by Cowpox or
other charm, would tend to exemption.</p>

<p>Jesty’s reasons for his experiment were thus specified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was led to undertake the novel practice in 1774 to counteract
the Smallpox, at that time prevalent at Yetminster, from knowing
the common opinion of the country ever since he was a boy (now
60 years ago) that persons who had gone through the Cowpock
naturally, that is to say by taking it from cows, were insusceptible
of the Smallpox.</p>

<p>By himself being incapable of taking the Smallpox, having gone
through the Cowpock many years before.</p>

<p>From knowing many individuals who after the Cowpock could
not have the Smallpox excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>From believing that the Cowpock was an affection free from
danger; and from his opinion that by the Cowpock Inoculation he
should avoid engrafting various diseases of the human constitution,
such as “the Evil, madness, lues, and many bad humours,” as he
called them.</p></div>

<p>In these reasons we have the Cowpox doctrine as
prevalent in Dorsetshire, which Jesty developed in family
practice. The report proceeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The remarkably vigorous health of Mr. Jesty, his wife, and two
sons, now 31 years subsequent to the Cowpock, and his own
healthy appearance, at this time 70 years of age, afford a singularly
strong proof of the harmlessness of that affection; but the
public must, with particular interest, hear that during the late
visit to town, Mr. Robert Jesty submitted publicly to inoculation
for the Smallpox in the most rigorous manner; and that Mr. Jesty
also was subjected to the trial of inoculation for the Cowpock after
the most efficacious mode, without either of them being infected.</p></div>

<p>It is curious how evidence conforms to prepossession.
Dr. Pearson and his associates were persuaded that as no
one could have Smallpox twice, neither could any one
have Cowpox twice. Jesty had Cowpox when young,
and when at three score they found him insusceptible,
they took it for granted that re-vaccination was impossible.
Robert Jesty, who had Cowpox thirty-one years before
was at the same time inoculated with Smallpox, and as
that likewise failed to take, the experiment enforced the
desired conclusion.</p>

<p>Having turned out so well, praise and portraiture were
bestowed on Jesty&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The circumstances in which Mr. Jesty purposely instituted the
Vaccine Pock Inoculation in his own family, namely, without any
precedent, but merely from reasoning upon the nature of the
affection among cows, and from knowing its effects in the casual
way among men, his exemption from the prevailing popular
prejudices, and his disregard of the clamorous reproaches of his
neighbours, will entitle him, in our opinion, to the respect of the
public for his superior strength of mind. Further, his conduct in
again furnishing such decisive proofs of the permanent anti-variolous
efficacy of the Cowpock, in the present [1805] discontented
state of mind in many families, by submitting to Inoculation, justly
claims at least the gratitude of the country.</p>

<p>As a testimony of our personal regard, and to commemorate so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
extraordinary a fact as that of preventing the Smallpox by inoculating
for the Cowpock 31 years ago, at our request, a three-quarter
length picture of Mr. Jesty is painted by that excellent artist, Mr.
Sharp, to be preserved at the Original Vaccine Pock Institution.</p>

inoculated with Cowpox, sharing the dairymaids’ faith
that it prevented Smallpox. Jenner knew that the
dairymaids were wrong, and that Cowpox did not avert
Smallpox. What he recommended was Cowpox produced
by Horsegrease. Pearson and Woodville disregarded
Jenner’s recommendation and made use of
Cowpox like Jesty, which substitution Jenner did not
resist; and not only did not resist, but claimed as the
fulfilment of his programme! Jenner should never be
suffered to get mixed up with Jesty, and the course of
his procedure be thereby obscured.</p>

<p>I am explicit to iteration because the truth is not

Cowpox, what of the ascription of its virtue to

of the House of Commons in 1802 compelled to disallow
Jenner’s claim to the discovery, and to define and limit his
merit to the propagation of its virus from arm to arm?
It was, however, Pearson and Woodville who first propagated
Cowpox from arm to arm: Jenner’s start being
made with Horsegrease Cowpox. But allowing him so
much credit, it is nevertheless to be remembered that it
was at that time a frequent practice to inoculate with
Smallpox from arm to arm; and the substitution of Cowpox
for Smallpox was a trifle for which to pay £10,000
and dissolve in ecstasies of admiration.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">OBSERVATIONS ON THE POSITION IN 1802.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">One of my medical readers observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The House of Commons in 1802 was committed to a variety of
extravagances, but, allowing for these, you have to account for certain
evidence that Cowpox had <em>some</em> influence over Smallpox; for
you surely do not mean to contend that it had <em>no</em> influence over
that disease, and that the evidence before the Committee was a
uniform tissue of illusion and delusion.</p></div>

<p>Put thus, it is as difficult to deal with the objection
as it is to prove a negative. It is not for me to define
the influence of cowpox over smallpox, but for those
who believe in its prophylaxy. I should argue that as
ill-health leads to ill-health, and as corruption breeds
corruption, that inoculated cowpox would generate a
habit of body favourable to smallpox, and at the same
time tend to excite and intensify other forms of disease.
I would also ask, What are the extravagances to be
allowed for? When these are determined we may then
proceed to discuss what are not extravagant. It is a
common form of evasion to make a general confession of
guilt in order to avoid the pain of specific and explicit
condemnation. It is conceded that the House of Commons
in 1802 “committed a variety of extravagances,” and
under this appearance of candour the chief extravagance
is implicitly re-asserted and carried forward, namely, that
inoculated cowpox had an influence adverse to smallpox.</p>

<p>In the “variety of extravagances,” few, I suppose, would
hesitate to include the asserted annual smallpox mortality
of the United Kingdom. Sir Gilbert Blane pronounced
it 45,000, while Dr. Lettsom gave it as 36,000&mdash;a wide
difference in the play of fancy! Dr. Lettsom, who claimed
to have paid much attention to figures connected with
smallpox, was pleased to convert an extreme London
mortality, namely, 3000, into the ordinary mortality,
although in some years it fell under 1000. Then estimating
the population of London at one million, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
population of the United Kingdom as twelve millions,
he multiplied 3000 by 12, and evoked the astounding
national death-rate of 36,000 annually from smallpox, all
of whom were to be saved by Jenner’s prescription!
But whether he had taken the average or even the
lowest metropolitan mortality, the computation would
have remained grossly fallacious. London overcrowded
and pestiferous, was no standard for the general population,
urban or rural; and the assumption was monstrous
that smallpox, a notoriously sporadic disease, was constant
and equally diffused over the land. We are without
comprehensive vital statistics for the time in question,
but arguing from the London of to-day in continual connection
with the provinces, to the London of 1802 in
comparative isolation, what do we find? Why, smallpox
prevalent in London with little or no smallpox in the
country! In the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> of 31st May, 1878,
we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The degree in which the Smallpox epidemic of the last seven
years has been localised in London is very remarkable. The
<cite>Lancet</cite> points out that during the week ending 25th May, 51 fatal
cases were registered in London and its suburban districts, whereas
not one was recorded in any of the nineteen large provincial towns
having an aggregate population about equal to that of London.
Since the beginning of the year the fatal cases of Smallpox within
fifteen miles of Charing Cross have been 1,134, while but 8 have
occurred in the nineteen other large towns.</p></div>

<p>We find similar illustrations of the sporadic character
of smallpox wherever we can get at the facts. In 1874
there died in London 735 of smallpox, but not one in
Birmingham; 386 in Liverpool, but not one in Plymouth;
347 in Salford, but not one in Nottingham; 190 in Manchester,
and but 1 in Sheffield; 24 in Bristol and 4 in
Leeds; and so on. What reason is there to believe that
what is true of smallpox within our own experience was
otherwise in the experience of our forefathers?</p>

<p>I said that few would hesitate to include Dr. Lettsom’s
36,000 and Sir Gilbert Blane’s 45,000 among the extravagances
of 1802, but I forgot myself. We have a National
Health Society with the Duke of Westminster for President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and all manner of notables, aristocratic, philanthropic,
scientific, and literary, among its committee and
members. Now this Society issues a hand-bill of advices
and warnings relating to smallpox, approved too by the
Local Government Board, and there we find set forth as
unquestionable matter of fact&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Before the introduction of Vaccination Smallpox killed 40,000
persons yearly in this country.</em>”</p></div>

<p>We thus see how hard it is for a convenient fable to
die, even when known to be false, and how respectable
people will keep repeating it as long as they fancy it is
for good.</p>

<p>Absurd as was the extension of the ratio of London
smallpox to the populations of the United Kingdom, of
Europe, and of the world, the London disease itself
afforded little warrant for the extreme terms of horror
and dismay with which it was described. Smallpox did
not increase the death-rate of London: when smallpox
was most prevalent and least prevalent, the total mortality
was but slightly affected. As long as the sanitary
conditions of the great city remained unchanged, fevers
replaced smallpox and smallpox replaced fevers, and
whether deaths were from one form of disease or another,
so that the people died the same, what did it matter?
Smallpox when most prevalent was never accountable
for much more than 10 per cent. of the total London
mortality, and in some years for less than 3 per cent.;
and it is to be remembered that the larger portion of
that mortality was infantile mortality&mdash;smallpox being
in the great majority of cases a disease of the young;
none the less objectionable on that account, but less
chargeable than some other forms of zymotic disease
with striking down the adult bread-winner and enlarging
misery and pauperism.</p>

<p>Again, in much of the talk about smallpox, it was
assumed that the disease had no limits&mdash;that it was
something like fire, and might spread to any extent if
unchecked. But what was there to justify such an
assumption? Assuredly nothing in London experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Smallpox was always present in London, waxing and
waning under some unknown law; the deaths rising as
high as 3992 in 1772 and falling as low as 522 in 1797&mdash;the
extremes of the century. Why did 4000 never die
in any year, or 7000, or 10,000? When a fire is extinguished,
we know it has met with a check; and if smallpox
caused 3992 deaths in 1772 and 522 in 1797, and
smallpox be like fire, there was, we see, a check; and I
ask, What was that check? There may be answers, but
none for unreserved acceptance. What is certain is, that
in London smallpox was never an illimitable affliction.
It had limits, and it was only in the rhetoric of alarmists
that it had none.</p>

<p>And the check to the disease (whatever it was) lay in
the bodies of the citizens, and not in their therapeutics.
Isolation was rarely attempted, and in their crowded
habitations was impracticable. Moreover they had not
only the smallpox appropriate to their evil conditions to
contend with, but the disease as propagated and diffused
by the inoculators. What we have to say is, that whilst
in the London of last century we behold smallpox endemic
and cultivated, yet in no year did the mortality
therefrom exceed 4,000; and further, that with so much
to favour and stimulate the disease it was a diminishing
quantity. In the words of Dr. Farr&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>London Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after inoculation
was introduced, and the disease began to grow less fatal before
vaccination was discovered.</p></div>

<p>We shall see as we proceed how the natural check to
smallpox (whatever it was), the immunity of the majority
from infection, and the decline of the disease were all
claimed as the blessed results of Jenner’s prescription;
and now-a-days it has passed into common-place, for
which evidence is thought superfluous, that without that
prescription smallpox might have illimitable extension.
If anywhere a variolous epidemic is slight, it is said that
but for vaccination it would have been severe; and if
severe, that its intensity would have been doubled or
trebled save for the action of the same prophylactic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
We have a remarkable illustration of this style of
prophecy in the Report of the Select Committee of the
House of Commons upon the Vaccination Act of 1867,
dated 23rd May, 1871, where we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox unchecked by Vaccination, is one of the most terrible
and destructive of all diseases as regards the danger of infection,
the proportion of deaths among those attacked, and the permanent
injury to the survivors.</p>

<p>Your Committee believe that if Vaccination had not been general,
<em>the epidemic</em> [then prevalent] <em>would have become a pestilence,
raging with the destructive force of the Plague of the middle ages</em>.</p></div>

<p>What is beyond evidence is beyond refutation; and
the imaginations of M.P.’s, dull though they be, not
unfrequently prevail over their intelligence.</p>

<p>To set aside the mass of testimony adduced by Jenner’s
friends before the Commons’ Committee in 1802 is
sometimes described as a hopeless undertaking; but the
answer to such a boast is, that experience has nullified
the essential part of that testimony, and that there is
little left to account for. No well-informed medical
practitioner now believes what the Committee was led
to believe, that to be inoculated with cowpox was to be
secure from smallpox for life. The security, where still
credited, is subject to so many qualifications that the
primitive inoculators with cowpox would have thought
such protection not worth paying for, still less of exulting
over as the greatest discovery ever made in medicine.
Nor would many now admit the validity of the Variolous
Test which then carried conviction with irresistible
force. Inoculation with smallpox was in itself an uncertain
operation, and that it should fail after inoculation
with cowpox, ere the poisoning of the blood had been
worked off, was in nowise surprising. The exposure of
vaccinated subjects to smallpox infection was in like
manner deceptive; and it was conveniently forgotten
that all manner of people were exposed to contagion with
impunity in the usual circumstances of life. Taking a
year of exceptional smallpox in London, such as Dr.
Lettsom set forth as ordinary, when 18,000 were affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and 3000 died (that is one in six), there were in the
million of inhabitants 982,000 who escaped. How did
they escape? A multitude must have come into immediate
contact with the sick: How did they remain unscathed?
The question is simple, but it is crucial. If
smallpox were like fire, and men, women, and children
like fuel, why did not all burn? Under what prophylaxy
did they abide secure? Again in this connection,
we must not lose sight of the magic of faith. Things
being equal, two persons exposed to smallpox, one confident
that he was invulnerable through vaccination, and
the other apprehensive of danger, the chances are, that
the fearful would be attacked whilst the fearless would
have his faith justified in immunity.</p>

<p>In considerations thus obvious it is not difficult to
understand how the testimony delivered to the Committee
had a semblance as of veracious Nature. Any one
who has studied the history of remedies, or the various
quackeries within his own observation, will know how
easy it is to conjure up testimony, with asseverations
presumptuous to question, which by-and-by are gradually
discredited and ultimately disappear in forgetfulness. I
have, therefore, no disposition to be hard on the men of
1802. From our vantage of experience we see how they
were led astray, and recognise the pressure of the influences
under which they acted. Moreover a remedy that
bore the promise of relief from the pest of smallpox
inoculation came with strong seduction. What a pest
that inoculation was, how it was loathed, and how it was
submitted to under the persuasion of duty are written
at large in the domestic memoirs of last century. Every
mother among the upper and middle classes was persuaded
that it was necessary for her children to undergo
the variolous ordeal&mdash;an ordeal that involved the deliberate
introduction of smallpox into her household. It
was hateful, it was intolerable, and yet it had to be
endured! The doctors minimised the risks to the uttermost,
but what they really believed plainly appeared
when vaccination presented itself as an alternative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Then smallpox inoculation was denounced by its former
practitioners with a fervour that contrasted painfully
with their antecedent professions; whilst parents heard
with indescribable satisfaction that absolute life-long
security from smallpox was henceforward insured at the
price of a trifling operation attended by no peril whatever,
and with distinct benefit to health. To make the
contrast clear I subjoin copy of a hand-bill that was
posted on walls and circulated by thousands in London
and the country at the time of which I write, 1801-2.</p>

<p class="fs70">From this faithful statement of the advantages attending <span class="smcap">Vaccine
Inoculation</span>, it must appear evident to every unprejudiced person,
that it is the duty as well as the interest of every parent, of every
individual, and of every nation, to adopt the practice, and to hasten</p>

<p class="pfs80">THE EXTERMINATION OF THE SMALLPOX.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>It was thus that Vaccination was introduced to the
English people, not by men accounted quacks, but by
leaders of the medical profession; and whatever the
illusions and mischiefs of the new practice, we must
allow it the credit of discouraging and ultimately superseding
the grosser practice of inoculation with smallpox.
As for the various items in the bill, we have had, and
shall have them before us, and I would only now recall
attention to the initial statement that “Smallpox destroys
a tenth part of mankind.” The summary answer
to the statement is that the number of mankind was
unknown, likewise their diseases, and the proportion in
which they were fatal. It was a repetition of Dr. Lettsom’s
unwarrantable extension of a bad year of London
smallpox to the whole earth. Even in an occasional
year when upwards of 3000 died in London of smallpox,
the total average mortality was not seriously affected
thereby. The deaths, as we have observed, were merely
taken out in smallpox instead of in some other form of
fever. That nothing can permanently reduce the death-rate
of any community save improved sanitary conditions
and personal habits was unrevealed in 1802.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the exultation over Jenner, “the
saviour of the world from smallpox,” and over “the
greatest discovery since the creation of man,” the suspicion
is unavoidable that it was largely factitious&mdash;“from
the teeth outwards,” as Carlyle would have said.
The vote of £10,000 to the miraculous benefactor of the
human race was carried by a majority of three in a Parliament
to which no more than 115 members could be
whipped up, and neither Pitt or Fox thought it worth
while to be present. Nor was Jenner treated as if his
asserted services to mankind were soberly credited.
“Yes,” it may be said, “the world never recognises its
true benefactors;” but the observation does not apply,
for Jenner was profusely recognised, and received praise
from his contemporaries which posterity hesitates to
repeat. Nevertheless the praise, though profuse, was
little more than verbal. Some expressed indignation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the paltry award of £10,000, and proposed to start a
national subscription, but no one took the initiative, and
the national gratitude was not put to the test. Even
the £10,000 was paid tardily. Writing to a friend on
3rd June, 1804, Jenner had to relate that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Treasury still withholds the payment of what was voted to
me two years ago; and now there are new officers, and it may yet
be very long before a guinea reaches me from that quarter.</p></div>

<p>When at last the money was paid, nearly £1000 was
deducted for fees, etc.; and, having the repute of the
money, he was considered public property. As Dr.
Baron records&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people of England seemed to think that the fee-simple of
his body and mind had been purchased by the <span class="fs70">TEN THOUSAND
POUNDS</span>; and many an unjust and ungenerous intimation of this
feeling was conveyed to him. To a mind like his, this was no
small annoyance. He was called upon for explanations and
opinions by every person who thought a direct communication
with the Author of Vaccination an honour worth seeking, while
they might have obtained all the information they wanted in his
published writings.</p></div>

<p>So much was matter of course, but Jenner had worse
to encounter. He took the fine talk of his medical and
political friends <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au sérieux</i>, bade farewell to Berkeley,
and set up as London physician in Hertford Street, May
Fair. The result we have in his own words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Elated and allured by the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
I took a house in London for ten years, at a high rent,
and furnished it; but my first year’s practice convinced me of my
own temerity and imprudence, and the falsity of the Minister’s
prediction. My fees fell off both in number and value; for, extraordinary
to tell, some of those families in which I had been before
employed, now sent to their own domestic surgeons or apothecaries
to inoculate their children, alleging that they could not think of
troubling Dr. Jenner about a thing executed so easily as vaccine
inoculation. Others, who gave me such fees as I thought myself
entitled to at the first inoculation, reduced them at the second, and
sank them still lower at the third.</p></div>

<p>His fees did not amount to £350 a year, and he
presently found himself nothing the better for the parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
grant, and involved in grave financial difficulties.
He wrote to a friend, 2nd November, 1804&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The London smoke is apt to cloud our best faculties. I do not
intend to risk the injury of mine in this way, unless occasionally
for the transaction of business. The public has not the smallest
right to require such a sacrifice of me. I have received no reward
for showing them how to remove one of the greatest obstacles to
human happiness; but, on the contrary, am loaded with a tax of
more than £400 a year!</p></div>

<p>And to another correspondent&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have now completely made up my mind respecting London.
I have done with it, and have again commenced as village doctor.
I found my purse not equal to the sinking of a £1000 annually
(which has actually been the case for several successive years) nor
the gratitude of the public deserving such a sacrifice. How hard
after what I have done, the toils I have gone through, and the
anxieties I have endured <em>in obtaining for the world a greater gift
than man ever bestowed on the world before</em> (excuse this burst of
egotism), to be thrown by with a bare remuneration of my
expenses.</p></div>

<p>It was hard! People who attributed to Jenner the
greatest discovery ever made, the preservation of from
36,000 to 45,000 lives annually in the United Kingdom,
and the salvation of the human race from smallpox, were
indeed entitled to have dealt with him more handsomely.
He had sympathisers and candid friends. “Your liberality
and disinterestedness every one must admire,”
wrote Mr. Benjamin Travers, “but you are sadly
deficient in worldly wisdom. If you had undertaken
the extinction of the smallpox yourself, with coadjutors
of your own appointment, I am confident, you might
have put £100,000 in your pocket; and the glory would
have been as great and the benefit to the community the
same.” How that £100,000 was used to tantalise him!
and yet, as Dr. Pearson pointed out, never any one
showed on what practicable terms the immense sum
could have been earned by means of cowpox.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-hdr">THE ROYAL JENNERIAN SOCIETY.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Jenner, jealous of Pearson, was anxious to supersede
the Institution for the Inoculation of the Vaccine Pock
established by him in 1799; but Jenner was what Scots
call “a feckless creature,” whose wishes rarely issue in
fruit. After his success in Parliament, he did not remain
in London to improve his opportunities, but retreated
to domestic quiet at Berkeley and Cheltenham. His
friends, however, were mindful of him, and Dr. Hawes,
Mr. Addington, surgeon, Benjamin Travers, and Joseph
Leaper met in Queen Street, City, 3rd December, 1802,
and resolved to establish a “<span class="smcap">Jennerian Society</span> for the
Extinction of the Small-Pox.” Mr. Addington transmitted
the resolution of the meeting to Jenner, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We look to your direction and assistance, and feel very desirous
of knowing when it is probable we may have the pleasure of seeing
you in town.</p></div>

<p>Joseph Fox of Lombard Street, dentist and enthusiastic
promoter of the new inoculation, also wrote to him, 4th
December, soliciting his co-operation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The plan which is in agitation is of the most extensive and
liberal kind. It is even expected that the Royal countenance will
be gained; but much depends upon thee. All are looking toward
thee as the proper person to lay the foundation-stone. It would be
well if this could be done in the course of the present year, particularly
as it is the memorable time when the practice received
parliamentary sanction.</p></div>

<p>But the ease-loving Jenner was not to be drawn. He
wrote to Mr. Addington from Berkeley, 10th December,
1802&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your very obliging letter found me just returned with my wife
and children to our pleasant home, where I promised myself a few
weeks of domestic comfort after some years spent in constant
anxieties.</p>

<p>This is the pull on one side. On the other is the delightful
prospect held up to my view of an Establishment for the promotion
of Universal Vaccine Inoculation&mdash;an establishment to which
I have for years been looking forward with a longing eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>I need not go farther into explanation, and shall only say, that
if it be incompatible with the generous design to suffer me to
remain here for the time I had allowed myself, I will certainly
comply with the wishes of my friends and go to town. Yet it must
be observed that I humbly conceive and ardently hope that my
presence will not be absolutely necessary. I have written to my
friend Dr. Lettsom and requested him to have the kindness to be
(as far as such a thing is admissible) my representative. In his
judgment on the present occasion I can place every confidence.</p></div>

<p>The letter describes the man. He did not like to be
troubled&mdash;not even when action stood for the advancement
of his own glory. As Pearson observed, “If Vaccination
had been left to Jenner, it would never have
come to anything.” Benjamin Travers also wrote to him
at the same time urging the necessity of his presence in
London, but he was put off with similar excuses and with
expectations of assistance from the public purse&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Government, I have no doubt, will give due support to so just
and laudable an undertaking. I am warranted in this suggestion
by a long conversation I had with Mr. Abbott, Speaker of the
House of Commons, who said that after the investigation of the
Parliamentary Committee he thought it became a public duty to
form Institutions for Gratuitous Inoculation.</p></div>

<p>As Jenner was not to be had, the promoters set to
work without him, and their triumph was complete when
at a meeting in the London Tavern on 17th February,
1803, it was announced that his Majesty had graciously
condescended to become the patron of “<span class="smcap">The Royal
Jennerian Society</span> for the Extermination of the Smallpox:”
that her Majesty had with great benignity
acquiesced in the request to become patroness: that his
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and their Royal
Highnesses the Duke of York, the Duke of Clarence, and
the Duke of Cumberland, had evinced, in a most flattering
manner, their willingness to accept the office of
vice-patrons: that his Grace the Duke of Bedford had
consented to fill the office of president; and that many
prelates, noblemen, and gentlemen of the highest rank
and respectability had agreed to be vice-presidents of the
Society.</p>

<p>The approval of the Prince of Wales was conveyed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a letter of the Earl of Egremont, over which Baron,
Jenner’s biographer (writing when the Prince had blossomed
into George IV.), bursts into worship in capitals,
as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The gracious and beneficent mind of the Illustrious writer is displayed
in every line; and the whole is truly characteristic of those
great qualities which continue to add lustre to his still more
<span class="smcap">Exalted Station</span> and shed so much of real glory on his <span class="smcap">Reign</span>.</p></div>

<p>Subscriptions flowed in freely. The Corporation of
London gave £500, the East India Company £100, the
Duke of Bedford £50, and guineas ten, five, two and one
were contributed with a liberality that attested the
fervour of the common credulity. But it was much
easier to get money than to administer it with a nice
adjustment of means to ends. The Jennerians, too, were
over-organised. There were a Medical Council and a
Board of Directors. The Medical Council consisted of
twenty-five Physicians and twenty-two Surgeons of the
first eminence in London, with Jenner for president
and Lettsom for vice-president. Such mechanism could
never work, and at the point where real business was to
be transacted, an officer was selected of extraordinary
character.</p>

<p>John Walker was born at Cockermouth in 1759, and
was a school-fellow of Woodville, subsequently physician
to the London Smallpox Hospital. After a rambling
career as blacksmith, engraver, and school-master, he
turned his attention to medicine, graduated at Leyden,
associated with French revolutionists in the guise of a
member of the Society of Friends; then accompanied
Dr. Marshall in a vaccinating cruise to the Mediterranean,
from whence, after a variety of adventures in war and
weather, he appeared in London in 1802, habited as a
Quaker with a long beard&mdash;an apparition in a clean
shaven community. Joseph Fox, the dentist of Lombard
Street, gave him the use of a part of his house, and there,
in his own words, “I set up my <span class="smcap">Vaccinium</span> for the
glorious cause.” As soon as the Jennerian Society was
initiated, Walker was put forward by Joseph Fox and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
other Friends as inoculator-in-chief, and Walker made
application in the following terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center smcap">To the Jennerian Society.</p>

<p>Friends,&mdash;Perhaps there is not any individual who has greater
reason to be gratified with the interest ye are taking in the Vacciole
Inoculation than myself.</p>

<p>Of late years, the practice of it has been the chief business of my
life, and I am partly indebted, during some of the last months, to
the zeal of individual members of your Society for being enabled
to continue it. They have sent patients to me from remote and
distant parts of this extensive City, when, for want of notoriety, I
might otherwise have been unemployed.</p>

<p>May I offer to you my services in this way: during the infancy
of your Institution, you cannot do me a greater pleasure than to
increase my number of patients; for where I now vacciolate tens,
I could easily do the same for hundreds.</p>

<p>After this declaration, I hope you will consider the present
address as neither unseasonable nor intrusive, but rather as a
mark of unwavering zeal in the happy cause in which ye are now
embarking.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully,</p>

<p>When the day of election arrived, four, out of many,
were selected as candidates, one of them being Dr.
Domeier, a German, strongly recommended by the Queen
and Prince of Wales; but the Friends stood by their
man, and Dr. Walker was appointed Resident Inoculator
at the Central House of the Society in Salisbury Square
with a salary of £200 a year, coal and candles, and liberty
to take fees for private “vacciolation.”</p>

<p>The promoters of the Society, operating under the
prestige of Jenner’s name, resolved to hold their annual
festival on his birthday, the 17th of May; and at the
first dinner in 1803 he was subjected to flatteries enough
to turn any man’s head who does not know the reckless
insincerity that prevails on such occasions. It was the
adulation connected with the formation of this Society
that as much as anything induced Jenner to set up as
west-end physician. The attempt of the middle-aged
country doctor was the occasion of much grim humour,
and his consequent <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'embarassments were'">embarrassments were</ins> the concern of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
his friends for many a day. Apart from the inherent
difficulties of the enterprise (social rather than medical)
Jenner was constitutionally deficient in method and
assiduity. Wrapped up in his wife and family, business
was always set aside when they claimed his affectionate
regard; and to leave London for Gloucestershire for some
domestic cause was in his eyes procedure that required
no defence&mdash;all which might be amiable, but it constantly
annoyed and frustrated his associates; and it is not thus
encumbered that any man can expect to make way in the
world. When the anniversary in 1804 came round, Jenner
was at Berkeley, and when pressed to attend he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though a post-chaise might bring up my body, my mind would
be left behind. One cause of my absence, among many others, is
the sad state of Mrs. Jenner’s health. I cannot leave her even for
a day with any comfort to my feelings. My friends, who honour
the glorious cause of Vaccination by assembling on the 17th, will,
I trust, admit my apology. It is my intention to collect a few
staunch Vaccinists on that day at my cottage. I shall give them
some roast beef, not forgetting a horn or two of good October.
We shall close the day with bumpers of milk-punch to the health
of the Friends of Humanity at the Crown and Anchor; and if it were
not for the indisposition of my poor wife, we should roar like bulls.</p></div>

<p>If Jenner was idle and self-indulgent, Walker was the
reverse. He was a fine specimen of the <span class="smcap">Genus</span>, <em>Fanatic</em>.
Possessed with a lust for what he called Vacciolation, he
had a brow of brass, nerves of steel, and habits like clockwork.
Thirteen stations were opened in London where
cowpox was inoculated gratis, and in eighteen months
Walker was able to announce that 12,288 patients had
been operated on, and that 19,352 charges of virus had
been dispatched to the country and foreign parts; whereon
Baron observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The effect of these exertions was immediately perceived by a
striking diminution of the number of deaths from smallpox within
the Bills of Mortality. In 1803 they amounted to 1173; in 1804 they
were only 622. The contrast will appear still greater when it is
considered that the deaths amounted to 2409 in the year 1800; and
that the annual average of deaths for fifty years previously was
2018.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The passage is noteworthy as representative of many
similar passages in the literature of Vaccination. It might
be described as dishonest, but the craft is so transparent
that the epithet would be extravagant. The probable
explanation is, that Vaccination had come to be regarded
as so unquestionably beneficial that <em>anything</em> might be
asserted in its favour, and that <em>anything</em> was true. Else
a child might have asked how 12,000 or 24,000 vaccinations
could by any possibility affect an immediate diminution
in the deaths from smallpox in a population of eight
or nine hundred thousand. Baron would also lead his
readers to suppose that the low mortality of 1804, namely
622, was unexampled, though with the Bills of Mortality
before him, he might have seen that the deaths in 1797
fell to 522; and he knew that the low figure of 1804
was not maintained, but rose to 1685 in 1805. But as
remarked, <em>any statement</em>, if only it be favourable to
Vaccination, is expected to pass muster as veracious, and
the public credulity justifies the expectation.</p>

<p>Let us look at the London Bills for ourselves, taking
the last ten years of the 18th and the first ten years of
the 19th Centuries, and try to discover what they teach.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that we have not here the record
of the deaths in the whole of London, but merely the
number of intramural interments, which diminished as a
number of graveyards became gorged beyond capacity of
decomposition and assimilation, and relief was sought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the cemeteries of extra-mural parishes, such as St. Pancras
and Marylebone. It is only thus that the diminishing
number of burials (which ranged from 25,000 to 30,000
during many years of the 18th Century) is to be accounted
for. In this light we have to consider the following
table, where we note fewer burials, less smallpox, less
fevers, but more measles.</p>

<p>From whatever cause there was an abatement of smallpox,
but it was a continuous abatement which had set in
before Jenner was heard of; and at the same time we
must repeat that at this day (when all swear by the
unity of Nature and the correlation and convertibility of
her forces) it is grossly unscientific to pick out smallpox
from the zymotic diseases and deal with it as an independent
entity. It is a fever among fevers, bred and
propagated in the same conditions, and can never be
studied apart from its associates without serious misunderstanding.</p>

<p>These Bills of Mortality, as compared with the more
accurate statistics of our own time, are of little value;
but, such as they are, they are constantly referred to, and
their items used, as by Baron, as pretexts for most unwarrantable
assertions. Any influence of Vaccination
on the smallpox mortality of 1801-10 was practically
nothing. Vaccination was limited to a few thousands,
and those chiefly of the classes least subject to the disease.
The great seething mass of metropolitan squalor, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
smallpox and typhus were endemic, was untouched by
the vaccine lancet. If the new practice did good, it was
in discrediting and discouraging the culture of smallpox
in variolous inoculation.</p>

<p>To return to the <span class="smcap">Royal Jennerian Society</span>. Its
halcyon-days were of brief duration. Enthusiasm abated,
subscriptions fell off, cases of smallpox after vaccination
came to be heard of, and serious illness and death
consequent upon “the benign and harmless operation.”
Opponents waxed bold and could not be silenced. Then
jealousies and dissensions began to operate within the
Society. The financial secretary strove with the medical
secretary. Dr. Walker’s habits and eccentricities, viewed
at first with amusement, excited irritation and disgust,
whilst Jenner’s easy-going mode of life and impecuniosity
were a source of scandal and distrust. The climax was
reached in 1806 when Jenner and Walker were set openly
at loggerheads, and a fight to the death ensued.</p>

<p>Walker, it is to be said, never treated Jenner with
respect. Like Pearson he took stock of his merits, and
did not rate them highly, and would not listen to his dictation.
“Vaccination,” he used to observe, “is extremely
simple as to facts, while, as to causes, it is entirely out of
the reach of medical men with all their theories.” Jenner,
as president of the Medical Council, thought he had a
right to be obeyed, but Walker was the last man in the
world to yield obedience when he had formed an opposite
conviction&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jenner [writes Baron] considered it his duty to admonish him,
and repeatedly represented to him, in the most friendly manner,
the mischievous tendency of his innovations. These remonstrances
were unavailing, and he ceased to have any communication with
Dr. Walker after the summer of 1805; submitting rather to lament
in silence the fate of the Society than come before it as a public
accuser.</p></div>

<p>Of course such forbearance could not last long, and
instructions issued by Walker to the Nottingham Vaccine
Institution in March, 1806, were made the occasion of an
open rupture. Jenner brought Walker’s conduct under
the consideration of the Medical Council, and secured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
condemnation. The question was then referred to the
General Court of the Society on the 25th of July, when
a motion that Walker he dismissed from his office was
negatived by a majority of three, Walker being supported
by Sir Joseph Banks and Jenner by Dr. Sims. But the
victory was not satisfactory to Walker, and on the 8th
of August he put an end to the strife by sending in his
resignation.</p>

<p>Baron’s solemn account of the contest must appal
every ingenuous reader. Jenner, it is written, regarded
Walker’s proceedings as of “the most dangerous character,”
as “placing in peril the safety of the practice,” and
“as likely to wreck the Society”; so that had he not
retired Jenner would have been compelled to withdraw
his countenance from Salisbury Square. As we read we
exclaim, Whatever did the dreadful Doctor do? Here is
Baron’s answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is unnecessary to mention the specific instances of misconduct
which were established. They regarded even the very name of the
affection; the method of managing the pustules; the characters of
correct vaccination; the precautions to be observed in conducting
the practice, etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>Moore states the offence plainly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Walker’s method of taking lymph was to cut open the vesicles,
and to wipe out the contents with lint, in order to procure the
fresh secretion. This harsh treatment of infants was the reverse of
that which he was directed to employ; and as he was unalterable in
his resolution, it was at length deemed necessary to remove him.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p></div>

<p>Turning to the <cite>Life of Walker</cite>, by Dr. Epps, we have
the difference ’twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee still
further illustrated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two different modes have been adopted in taking the matter of
inoculation from the vaccinated subject: one, by making punctures
round the outer part of the pock, Dr. Jenner’s mode; the other,
by removing the crust or scab from the centre of the pock, wiping
out the fluid beneath it, and then taking the matter, indiscriminately,
from any part of the whole substance of the pock, Dr. Walker’s
mode.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>As in brawls and wars generally, the ostensible offence
is rarely the true or entire offence, so when we revert
to the events of 1805-6 we discover that Vaccination
was being found out, and that Walker served Jenner’s
purpose opportunely as scape-goat. Walker’s behaviour,
too, constituted him a convenient victim. Many who
cared nothing for his mode of “taking lymph” had been
hurt by his scorn of their self-importance, and were
ready to assist Jenner in effecting his humiliation. Mr.
Cline, the surgeon, after listening to many speeches
against Walker, summed up the indictment, “All they
complain of are his <em>dress</em> and <em>address</em>.” A naval officer,
meeting Walker on 25th July, said, “I came to town
to-day to hold up my hand in your support. You and
Jenner do not agree over some trifles, and your enemies
wish to turn the fact to your hurt, but they have been
beaten. Is the man who launches a vessel the only one
who can navigate her? If Jenner were to live for fifty
years to come, he could never have the authority of your
experience.”</p>

<p>Jenner’s victory over Walker was utterly disastrous: it
destroyed the Royal Jennerian Society. The substantial
supporters of the Society were the adherents of Walker,
and with him they seceded, secured another house in
Salisbury Square, and established <span class="smcap">The London Vaccine
Institution</span> with Walker for manager. The remnant
of the Jennerian Society appointed James Sheridan
Knowles, a young Irish surgeon, as Walker’s successor,
and for distinction purchased him the degree of M.D.
from St. Andrews. He had the suavity that Walker
disdained, and little else beside. He neglected his duties,
and soon the traffic in the “benign fluid” was transferred
to the new establishment. Ultimately the lease, fixtures,
and furniture of the Jennerian house were disposed of,
and a retreat effected to humbler offices, until in 1813
what remained of the Society was incorporated in
Walker’s concern.</p>

<p>Walker obtained much assistance from members of the
Society of Friends, and the fact affords Moore (Jenner’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
apologist) occasion for certain sneers. He describes the
meetings in Salisbury Square as&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shaded with the Quakers’ broad-brimmed hats; for their schismatic
assiduity was most conspicuous, though their primitive meekness
was indiscernible. In support of their friend, they argued slyly,
wrangled tumultuously, and voted almost unanimously. Yet, in
spite of this contentious pertinacity, the turbulent Quaker, on the
motion of Dr. Jenner, was dismissed from his office, and peace was
restored.</p></div>

<p>Dismissed he was not, and the peace that ensued on
his resignation was destruction. The success of Walker’s
Institution (necessarily dependent on subscriptions) he
accounts for by an anecdote like this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A noble Duke informed me that on a sultry day a steaming,
squab, broad-faced man, in a Quaker’s garb, with his hat on his
head, entered his room, saying, “Friend, I am come on a charitable
mission to request thy mite.” The Duke, amused with the oddness
of the salutation, desired him to be seated, and to explain his business.
The Quaker wilily suppressed all mention of disputes in the
Jennerian Society, and of the dismissal of Dr. Walker, which were
the real causes for soliciting this subscription; and enlarged tediously
on the utility of vaccination, and by awkward encomiums on
Dr. Jenner, led the Duke to believe that the subscription was
solicited for a Society approved by him. This cunning harangue
drew forth the Duke’s purse, which the Quaker spying, unrolled
his list, and added his Grace’s name as a decoy for others; and
saying, “Friend, fare thee well,” strutted out with an uncouth
gait and an air of uprightness. By such artifices a large subscription
was raised from those who prefer paying to inquiry; and in
the meantime the Jennerian Society diminished in numbers, and,
undermined by calumnies, declined to its downfall.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p></div>

<p>It is not to be imagined, however, that the collapse of
the Royal Jennerian Society disposed of Jenner and his
party. There was Jenner to provide for: he could not
with decency be forsaken: and there was a stock of
vaccine virus to be kept up, for which pride forbade
dependence on Walker’s dispensary. It was in vain to
appeal afresh to a benevolent public, whose confidence
had gone elsewhere, and whose suspicions were excited.
It was therefore determined to resort to Government for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
help. The political influence of the Jennerian party was
considerable, and we shall see to what purpose it was
exerted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4 class="no-brk">ORIGIN OF THE TERM VACCINATION.</h4>

<p>A new practice wants a new name, and it was some
time before one was found for Inoculation with Cowpox.
Dr. Walker made use of Vacciolation and to Vacciolate
in 1802; but it was Richard Dunning, surgeon, of Plymouth,
who introduced Vaccination and to Vaccinate.
Jenner writing to Dunning, 2nd April, 1804, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The useful terms Vaccination and to Vaccinate, are undoubtedly
yours, and as such I pronounced them at a meeting of the Royal
Jennerian Society, when an M.D. present mentioned them as
imported from the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p></div>

<p>Vaccination is not as yet a term accepted everywhere.
Among the uneducated we hear of being “cut for the
cowpock,” or simply of being “cut.”</p>

<p>Whilst Vaccination was a useful word, it was, and is,
often misapplied. Jenner’s prescription of Horsegrease
Cowpox was Equination rather than Vaccination; and
when virus from the horse was employed neat, Equination
was the accurate designation without question. Again,
when virus was generated from Smallpox on heifers,
the subsequent inoculation of the human subject was not
Vaccination but Variolation, or at least Variolous Vaccination.
The virus in public use at this day derived
from Horsegrease Cowpox, Cowpox, Horsepox, Smallpox,
Smallpox Cowpox, etc., etc., inoculated from arm-to-arm,
in series prolonged and unsearchable, is called Vaccination;
but it is Vaccination in faith or fancy, evidence to
anything but uncertainty being unattainable.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">APPLICATION TO PARLIAMENT FOR JENNER’S RELIEF, 1806.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Baron relates an instance of Jenner’s personal shyness
and the mental torture he endured in prospect of a festival
of the Royal Jennerian Society in which he was expected
to take part. Speaking to Baron he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I can compare my feelings to those of no one but Cowper, the
poet, when his intellect at last gave way to his fears about the
execution of his office in the House of Lords. It was reading
Cowper’s Life, I believe, that saved my own senses by putting me
fully in view of my danger. For many weeks before the meeting
I began to be agitated, and, as it approached, I was actually
deprived both of appetite and sleep; and when the day came, I
was obliged to deaden my sensibility and gain courage by brandy
and opium. The meeting was at length interrupted by a dissolution
of Parliament, which sent the leading people to the country;
and what was at first merely postponed was ultimately abandoned
to my no small delight and satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p></div>

<p>Something of this timidity was no doubt due to his
consciousness of playing a deceitful part, and to the
appropriation of honour and reward to which he had no
just claim. Like many shy men, Jenner could be insolent
with pen and ink&mdash;it was face to face courage to which
he was unequal; and this timidity, with other reasons,
accounted for his failure as a London physician&mdash;as “the
Cowpox Doctor,” as he was commonly described. Those
whose encouragement had helped to lead him to disaster,
those who were pleased to believe that he had taught
mankind how to escape from smallpox, and several of his
professional brethren, were all concerned to help him out
of his difficulties, and, if possible, at the public expense.
The Duchess of Devonshire wrote to Mr. Angerstein&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had not forgot your kind interest about Jenner. I spoke to the
Duke, the Prince, and Morpeth, and they will all do what you think
best; but Morpeth has undertaken to make inquiries whether it is
not possible to bring his case again before Parliament. He thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
if that could be done, it would be more satisfactory than any subscription.
I desired him to find out how Pitt was <em>really</em> inclined
in the matter, and I only waited the result of these inquiries to
write to you.</p></div>

<p>At the same time Jenner himself was not inactive, and
managed to advance his own interest effectually. He
came to London, 10th May, 1805, and at once saw Lord
Egremont, and enlarged upon the losses he had incurred
in the public service; the result being a determination
to appeal afresh to the liberality of the House of Commons.
Moreover he succeeded in winning over the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the manner he thus
describes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During my residence in town in the summer of 1805, Lady
Crewe happened in conversation to tell me how much Lord Henry
Petty wished for a conference with me on the vaccine subject; and
that she would like to bring us together. We met at her villa at
Hampstead, and went so fully into the matter that his Lordship,
convinced of the injury I had sustained, expressed his determination
to bring something forward in the ensuing session. Before
the session arrived Mr. Pitt died, and Lord Henry Petty became
Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the early part of 1806, I again
saw his Lordship, and found that his ardour in my cause had
suffered no abatement. This was soon after proved by his Lordship’s
motion in the House.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Henry brought Jenner’s case before the Commons
on the 2nd of July, and recited the fabulous matter communicated
to him with the force of personal conviction.
Vaccination was a preventive of smallpox, that loathsome
disease which spreads death throughout the world. It
was in 1777 that Jenner obtained some obscure knowledge
of the peculiar virtue of Vaccine; and from that
period he meditated profoundly on the subject, accumulated
information, and instituted cautious and decisive
experiments. At length he perfected his discovery, and
published it for the benefit of mankind. Lord Henry
then proceeded to relate the triumphs of Vaccination,
not only throughout Europe, but China and India!
Wherever the practice was introduced, there smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
diminished and vanished. There was Vienna, for instance,
where the average mortality from smallpox was 835
annually. Vaccination was commenced in 1799, and the
mortality dropped in 1802 to 61, in 1803 to 27, and in
1804 to 2. Thus in Vienna there was an annual salvation
of 833 human beings. This undoubted fact had made a
deep impression on his mind [as well it might!] But,
alas! what was doing so much good abroad was neglected
and distrusted at home. In the City of London the
deaths from smallpox had been on an average 1811
annually, and this mortality had been gradually reduced
by Vaccination to 629. Through the diffusion of the
disease by variolous inoculation, the deaths last year
(1805) had been raised from 629 to 1685. This dreadful
destruction of life, especially shocking when a certain
preventive existed, demanded their most serious attention,
and in the situation he felt bound to propose a plan
to bring forward a mass of evidence, to elicit the truth,
and enlighten the public. He would therefore move&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty, praying
that he will be graciously pleased to direct His Royal College of
Physicians to inquire into the state of Vaccine Inoculation in the
United Kingdom, and to report their opinion as to the progress it
has made, and the causes which have retarded its general adoption.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Should this report from the Physicians corroborate the
favourable opinion of Vaccination entertained by foreign
nations, it must greatly tend to subdue those prejudices
against the practice which have been fomented here.
And in that case, the House may consider whether the
ingenious Discoverer has been remunerated conformably
to the liberal spirit and character of this country.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Mathews</span> seconded the motion, and contrasted the
safety of the vaccine with the dangers of variolous inoculation.
He had no doubt the country would hasten to
testify still further its gratitude to the learned physician
to whom they owed this inestimable benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span> did not approve of the reference to
the College of Physicians. He would have preferred an
investigation by a committee of the House, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
committee of the House of Lords. The opinions of such
unbiased persons would be more congenial to the feelings
of the people, and far more satisfactory than any
medical report from the College of Physicians. The
latter might be suspected of being influenced by professional
motives, whereas a report from the Lords and
Commons would be universally received as proceeding
from a pure desire to promote the general good. It did
not surprise him that Vaccination had made less progress
at home than abroad. The resistance was due to that
curious principle in the human mind which accepts what
comes from afar with admiration whilst what is familiar
is neglected and despised. The remedy would be found
in diffusing information as to the complete success of
Vaccination in foreign countries. They would thus disperse
those absurd prejudices which are engendered and
fostered by certain selfish and interested individuals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Windham</span> did not concur in the advice of Mr.
Wilberforce to refer the matter to a parliamentary
committee. It was a question for medical men. To a
committee of the House the adage might be applied,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>. Let them enforce with their
approval the report of the physicians, and then let them
proceed to remunerate that meritorious individual to
whom society owed the utmost gratitude. He could not
help thinking he had not yet received what was due for
the expense and trouble the discovery had cost him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Banks</span> was of a sceptical turn. He wished the
motion had been made earlier in the session, for then he
should have supported the suggestion of Mr. Wilberforce.
They wished to know whether Vaccination really did
afford reasonable security from smallpox. It was not a
question for medical men for which the House was incompetent.
They were as capable of determining the
point, and setting it clearly before the public, as the
most learned body that ever existed. He wished too,
since the motion would be carried, that the Royal
College of Surgeons might be united with the Physicians
in the production of the report. As for Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Jenner, if Vaccination were as efficacious as asserted, he
might be left to find his reward in its practice.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Petty</span> in summing up the debate
expressed his satisfaction with the general approval
extended to his motion. He did not think the House
competent to form a judgment on Vaccination. They
could not decide whether cowpox was genuine or
spurious, or whether the affection resulting from its inoculation
was regular or otherwise; nor could they
determine whether eruptions that might break out after
Vaccination were induced by the operation, or were due
to other causes. Such delicate questions could only be
solved by medical men. As for the proposal to annex
the Royal College of Surgeons to that of the Physicians,
it was superfluous. The College of Physicians would
not only consult the Surgeons, but the Medical Colleges
of Scotland and Ireland likewise. If the report should
prove favourable, it would then be his duty to propose
that remuneration be awarded to Dr. Jenner for his
inestimable discovery.</p>

<p>The motion was then put from the Chair and agreed
to unanimously.</p>

<p>It is needless to remark that the report of the College
of Physicians was a mere formality toward a vote of
credit for Jenner’s relief. He lay heavy on many hands,
and none were more anxious to be relieved from the
pressure than certain influential members of the College
whose report was solicited. The operation was skilfully
planned for the end designed, and Lord Henry Petty
allowed himself to be primed and applied with singular
facility: but public men have often to deliver as of
themselves what is communicated by others, and to
stand responsible for absurdities of which they are unconscious.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">REPORT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The Report of the Physicians appeared on the 10th
April, 1807, a verbose document, wherein assertion and
conjecture were awkwardly intermingled. As to the
extension of the practice, it was said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During eight years which have elapsed since Dr. Jenner made
his discovery public, the progress of Vaccination has been rapid,
not only in all parts of the United Kingdom, but in every quarter
of the civilised world. In the British Islands some hundred
thousands have been vaccinated; in our possessions in the East
Indies upwards of 800,000, and among the nations of Europe the
practice has become general.</p>

<p>Professional men have submitted it to the fairest trials, and the
public for the most part have received it without prejudice. The
testimony in its favour has been most strong and satisfactory, and
the practice of it, though it has received a check in some quarters,
appears to be upon the increase in most parts of the United
Kingdom.</p></div>

<p>From the Report it appeared that the opposition to
Vaccination proceeded from the Inoculators; and the
document may be described as a charge against the old
practice as much as a positive defence of the new&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>However beneficial the inoculation of the Smallpox may have
been to individuals, it appears to have kept up a constant source
of contagion, which has been the means of increasing the number
of deaths by what is called the natural disease. It cannot be
doubted that this mischief has been extended by the inconsiderate
manner in which great numbers of persons, even since the introduction
of Vaccination, are every year inoculated with Smallpox,
and afterwards required to attend two or three times a-week at the
place of inoculation, through every stage of their illness.</p></div>

<p>Some Inoculators asserted that Vaccination produced
“new, unheard-of, and monstrous diseases,” and made
use of pictures to excite terror and disgust&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Publications with such representations have been widely circulated,
and though they originated either in gross ignorance, or
wilful misrepresentation, yet have they lessened the confidence of
many, particularly of the lower classes, in Vaccination.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever the character of Vaccination&mdash;had the claim
made in its favour been a true claim, still the chief
resistance to its practice would have consisted in the
common apathy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The lower orders of society can hardly be induced to adopt precautions
against evils which may be at a distance; nor can it be
expected from them, if these precautions be attended with expense.
Unless, therefore, from the immediate dread of epidemic Smallpox,
neither Vaccination or Inoculation appears at any time to have
been general, and when the cause of terror has passed by the public
have relapsed into indifference. It is not easy to suggest a remedy
for an evil so deeply implanted in human nature.</p></div>

<p>The suggestion was, however, made that Vaccination
should be offered gratis, but at the same time it was the
opinion of the College that until Variolous Inoculation
was superseded or prohibited, “it would be impossible to
prevent the constant recurrence of Natural Smallpox.”</p>

<p>The recommendation of Vaccination gratis provoked
the wrath of Dr. Moseley&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gratis! [he exclaimed]: Why, every person knows that for years
past in almost every street of London, signs or boards on the sides
of houses, or on Methodists’ shops, or in apothecaries’ windows,
have invited the ignorant multitude to gratuitous Vaccination. I
have seen as many gratis Cowpox hand-bills, gratis puffs, gratis
pathetic sermons and addresses, and gratis station advertisements
as would load an ox. What does the College think of the mountebank
Jennerian placard, dispersed on walls and alleys, and among
all the blackguard public houses in town and country, and hung
up in the shop or parlour of every Cowpoxer in England with
Their Majesties’ Names and those of Their August Family audaciously
emblazoned upon it?<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p></div>

<p>The Report of the College is interesting as a historic
confession and a mark of progress. The physicians who
drew it up were the same men who in 1800 professed
their unlimited confidence in Vaccination, whilst as yet
they knew little about it, proclaiming in the newspapers
that they considered it their duty to declare&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That those persons who have had the Cowpox are perfectly
secure from the future infection of the Smallpox.</em></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>From a profession so unqualified an absolute retractation
was not to be expected; but experience had begotten
caution, and it is instructive to remark with what qualifications
the retreat from the original position was
attempted. Thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The security derived from Vaccination <em>if not absolutely perfect</em>
is as nearly so as can perhaps be expected from any human discovery;
for among several hundred thousand cases, with the results
of which the College has been made acquainted, <em>the number of
alleged failures has been surprisingly small</em>, so much so as to form
no reasonable objection to the general adoption of Vaccination.</p></div>

<p>The Report was not the deliverance of men possessed
with the confidence of 1800: throughout there was
manifest the failing conviction which evades responsibility
and seeks for confirmation from sources external
to itself. After a reference to the Variolous Test, the
Report ran on&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It appears from numerous observations communicated to the
College, that those who have been vaccinated are secure from the
contagion of epidemic Smallpox. Towns and districts of country
in which Vaccination had been general, have afterwards had
Smallpox prevalent on all sides of them without suffering from the
contagion. There are also in the evidence a few examples of
epidemic Smallpox having been subdued by a general Vaccination.</p></div>

<p>The liability to confound coincidence with cause was
not unknown in 1807, and might have been suggested as
a possible explanation of the cessation of a variolous
epidemic contemporaneously with Vaccination; although
at the present day Vaccination, when Smallpox is epidemic,
is known to do little else than invite and extend
the malady.</p>

<p>How the general (that was to say partial) Vaccination
of certain towns and country districts secured universal
exemption from Smallpox, the Physicians failed to
explain. Extraordinary tales of Vicarious Vaccination
were current and piously received. If a fraction of an
urban or rural community happened to be vaccinated
(usually a fraction least likely to be troubled with Smallpox
in any event) and Smallpox did not break out, or
did not widely prevail, the salvation of the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was ascribed to the Vicarious Vaccination. The phenomenon
has, strange to say, escaped the attention of
theologians, although medical men constantly attest its
occurrence.</p>

<p>Ruefully was it conceded that Vaccination was not an
absolute preservative from Smallpox, but the pain of
concession was softened with the plea of mitigation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <em>almost</em> every case where Smallpox has succeeded Vaccination,
the disease has varied much from its ordinary course; it has neither
been the same in violence, nor in the duration of its symptoms, but
has, <em>with very few exceptions</em>, been remarkably mild, as if the
Smallpox had been deprived, by the previous vaccine disease, of
all its usual malignity.</p></div>

<p>It goes without saying, that such a statement was
quackish romance. How could a physician know that
any case of Smallpox had been made milder by Vaccination?
for how could he know how severe the disease
would have been without Vaccination? Any ground of
comparison was wanting. Smallpox is an eruptive fever
of wide degrees of intensity&mdash;slight as to be a trivial
ailment, severe as to be inevitably fatal. “So true,”
wrote Dr. Wagstaffe in 1722, “is that common observation,
that there is one sort in which a nurse cannot kill,
and another which even a physician cannot cure.” Yet
every case of mild Smallpox after Cowpox came into
fashion was placed to the credit of Vaccination!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some writers [the Report continues] have greatly undervalued
the security Vaccination affords, while others have considered it to
be of a temporary nature only; but if any reliance is to be placed
on the statements laid before the College, its power of protecting
the human body from Smallpox, <em>though not perfect indeed</em>, is
abundantly sufficient to recommend it to the prudent and dispassionate.
The opinion that Vaccination affords but a temporary
security is supported by no analogy in Nature, nor by the facts
which have hitherto occurred.</p></div>

<p>The analogy of Nature was a treacherous support,
whilst the Physicians did not foresee the time when
their successors would plead the fact of the temporary
security of Vaccination as a reason for systematic Re-Vaccination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not difficult to discern between the lines of the
Report a spirit of doubt and hesitation. Those who
framed it had gone too far to turn back; there was
Jenner on their hands; and a public ready to hoot if
there was any open apostasy. The outlook at home was
not encouraging, but there was the Continent, yea more,
the wide world itself wherein to cover the reproach of
failure&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They could not be insensible [said the Physicians] to the confirmation
they receive not only from the introduction of Vaccination
into every part of Europe, <em>but throughout the vast Continents of
Asia and America</em>.</p></div>

<p>The vast Continents of Asia and America! A fine
phrase&mdash;a very fine phrase, with more comfort in it than
scoffers might imagine.</p>

<p>In the Report we detect one good service, namely, the
explosion of Jenner’s fiction about Spurious Cowpox.
When Vaccination was first brought forward, cases were
adduced of Smallpox after Cowpox. Jenner at once
asserted that the Cowpox in such instances must have
been spurious, for Smallpox after genuine Cowpox was
impossible; and Spurious Cowpox was thenceforward
freely used to baffle inquirers and to account for failures.
Spurious Cowpox served the ends of the Vaccinators
magnificently, but by and by it began to have awkward
consequences. Genuine Cowpox was said to be harmless&mdash;it
was the Spurious that was ineffective or worked
mischief; and the Inoculators plied the terror of Spurious
Pox against Vaccination. It therefore became necessary
to clear Spurious Cowpox out of the way, and Jenner,
before the College of Physicians, pressed upon the point,
“owned up,” as Americans say, and authorised the following
explanation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some deviations from the usual course have occasionally occurred
in Vaccination, which the Author of the practice has called Spurious
Cowpox, <em>by which the public have been misled, as if there were a
true and a false Cowpox</em>; but it appears that nothing more was
meant than to express irregularity or difference from that common
form and progress of the vaccine pustule from which its efficacy is
inferred.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark! Here was a third definition of Spurious Cowpox
by Jenner.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> of 1798, he described Spurious
Cowpox as eruptions on the cow underived from horsegrease,
producing no erysipelas when inoculated on the
human subject, and without effect against Smallpox.
True Cowpox was generated from horsegrease, and from
horsegrease only.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, in the <cite>Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation</cite> of
1801 all reference to horsegrease was dropped for commercial
reasons, whilst the existence of Spurious Cowpox
was reasserted “as some varieties of spontaneous eruptions
upon the cow.”</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, before the Physicians in 1807, he removed the
spurious disease from the cow altogether, saying, nothing
more was meant by Spurious Cowpox than variations in
the form and progress of vaccine pustules on the arms of
the vaccinated!</p>

<p>In short, to vary the phrase of Betsy Prig, “There
never was no Spurious Cowpox.” Slippery, very slippery,
was the immortal Jenner.</p>

<p>With the report of the Royal College of Physicians
were delivered reports from the London College of Surgeons,
and from the Edinburgh and Dublin Colleges of
Physicians and of Surgeons.</p>

<p>The report from the London College of Surgeons was
considered most unsatisfactory, and could its tenor have
been foreseen, the Jennerians might never have asked for
it. 1100 circulars were dispatched on 15th December,
1806, to all the members of the College whose addresses
were known in the United Kingdom, submitting the
following questions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st. How many persons have you vaccinated?</p>

<p>2nd. Have any of your patients had Smallpox after Vaccination?</p>

<p>3rd. Have any bad effects occurred in your experience in consequence
of Vaccination? and if so, what are they?</p>

<p>4th. Is the practice of Vaccination increasing or decreasing in
your neighbourhood? if decreasing, to what cause do you impute it?</p></div>

<p>To the 1100 circulars only 426 replies were received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Why nearly two-thirds of the members kept silent when
at the outset they were converted in multitude to Vaccination,
was left unexplained. The replies were thus
summarised by the Board on 17th March, 1807&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The number of persons stated in such letters to have been vaccinated,
is 164,381.</p>

<p>The number of cases in which Smallpox had followed Vaccination
is 56.</p>

<p>The Board think it proper to remark under this head, that, in
the enumeration of cases in which Smallpox has succeeded Vaccination,
they have included none but those in which the subject was
vaccinated by the surgeon reporting the facts.</p>

<p>The bad consequences which have arisen from Vaccination are&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad6">
66 cases of eruption of the skin, and<br />
24 of inflammation of the arm, whereof<br />
&nbsp; 3 proved fatal.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Vaccination, in the greater number of Counties from
which reports have been received, appears to be increasing:
in the Metropolis it is on the decrease.</p>

<p>The principal reasons assigned for the decrease are&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent pad6">
Imperfect Vaccination,<br />
Instances of Smallpox after Vaccination,<br />
Supposed bad consequences,<br />
Publications against the practice,<br />
Popular prejudices.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The report of the Edinburgh College of Physicians
disowned acquaintance with Vaccination, the practice
being entirely in the hands of surgeons and other practitioners&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With a view, however, to publish their conviction of the immense
benefits which have been, and which will in future be derived to
the world, from Inoculation for the Cowpox, they had spontaneously
and unanimously elected Dr. Jenner an honorary Fellow of their
College, a mark of distinction which they very rarely confer, and
which they confine almost exclusively to Foreign Physicians of the
first eminence.</p></div>

<p>The report of the College of Surgeons, dated 3rd March,
1807, left nothing for the Jennerians to desire. The Edinburgh
surgeons were satisfied from their own experience
that Vaccination constituted a permanent security from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Smallpox, and they had observed no ill consequences from
the practice. Vaccination commenced in Edinburgh in
1801, and was now so general in the city&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That for two or three years past, Smallpox has been reckoned
rather a rare occurrence, even among the lower order of the inhabitants,
<em>unless in some particular quarters about twelve months
ago</em>. Among the higher ranks of the inhabitants the disease is
unknown.</p></div>

<p>Rare, unless in some quarters about a year ago! We
turn to the report of the Edinburgh Dispensary for 1805,
and there we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The loathsome disease has unfortunately been very prevalent in
several quarters of the city.</p></div>

<p>And this coincidently with extensive Vaccination to
which apparently there was no active opposition! We
have also to remember in this connection the statement
of Professor Alexander Monro in 1765, that “the inhabitants
of Scotland generally have Smallpox in their
infancy or childhood; very few adults being seen in
this disease”; and that in Edinburgh, with conditions
strongly favourable to Smallpox, the mortality from the
disease was on an average little more than a hundred a
year. The Edinburgh physicians knew nothing practically
of Vaccination, and we see how the Surgeons, who
did know, shaped their evidence.</p>

<p>The Dublin College of Physicians echoed the fashionable
opinion “that Cowpox Inoculation was safe, and
fully answered its purpose.” They were “willing to
allow that doubtful cases had occurred of Smallpox after
Vaccination, but on minute investigation, these supposed
instances originated generally in misrepresentation, or
the difficulty of discriminating between Smallpox and
other eruptions.” Rather awkwardly, seeing how the
opposite opinion was in vogue, they professed their faith
in Variolous Inoculation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Smallpox is rendered a much less formidable disease in
Ireland by the frequency of Inoculation for it, than in other parts
of His Majesty’s dominions, where prejudices against Inoculation
have prevailed. Hence parents, not unnaturally, object to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
introduction of a new disease, in the shape of Vaccination, preferring
to trust to the practice with the mildness and safety of
which they are well acquainted.</p></div>

<p>The Dublin College of Surgeons showed themselves
more fully abreast of the time. They had nothing to
say for Inoculation, but testified their confidence in
Vaccination, and how its practice was increasing in
Ireland. From 1800 to 1806 a total of 14,335 had been
“inoculated with vaccine infection” at the Dublin
institutions, and many elsewhere&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cowpox has been found to be a mild disease, and rarely attended
with danger, or any alarming symptom, and <em>the few cases of
Smallpox which have occurred in Ireland after supposed Vaccination</em>,
have been satisfactorily proved <em>to have arisen from
accidental circumstances</em>.</p></div>

<p>Arisen from accidental circumstances! Thus was the
divine illumination of experience veiled and denied!</p>

<p>Fortified with this budget of questionable evidence,
the Government proceeded to claim from the House of
Commons a second endowment for Jenner.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">JENNER RELIEVED&mdash;1807.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Whilst the Royal College of Physicians were preparing
their report, there was perturbation in the political
world. Dull and bigoted George III. refusing on the
pretext of his oath to concede to Roman Catholics the
rights of citizens, a change of administration ensued, and
Mr. Perceval, a man after the King’s own heart, replaced
Lord Henry Petty as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and proceeded to give effect to the plan for relieving
Jenner; a purpose for which the report “On the State
of Vaccine Inoculation in the United Kingdom” was
merely a blind.</p>

<p>On the 29th July, 1807, the House of Commons being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in Committee of Supply, Mr. <span class="smcap">Perceval</span> moved that Dr.
Jenner be awarded a second sum of £10,000 for his
matchless discovery. Smallpox was one of the greatest
afflictions of mankind, from which hardly any one
escaped. For this dreadful malady, Jenner had invented
a preventive, unknown before, or if known, which had
never been published. He did not therefore think the
Committee would consider his proposal extravagant;
indeed it was rather an act of justice than of liberality.
Those who had read the Report of the Physicians would
recognise the immense advantages of the new practice.
As for its inconveniences, they were as nothing to those
which attended Variolous Inoculation, and the few
mistakes recorded were due to ignorance and carelessness.
It might be objected by those who adhered to Mr.
Malthus, that nothing was gained by saving lives from
pestilence; for deaths were not losses where means of
subsistence were inadequate; but for his part he would
disregard the argument even if it were true. It was
much better to follow the dictates of their hearts, and
preserve life whenever it was within their power. He
had often heard that the true riches of a state were its
inhabitants. But he would not attempt to measure
Jenner’s award by the number of lives that his invention
would preserve to the world. If he did so, what sum
would they have to offer! All he need say was, that
the £10,000 proposed represented no more than a
moderate acknowledgment of labour and genius devoted
to the service of humanity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaw Lefevre</span> opposed the motion. He had
thought the former application for £20,000 excessive,
and had concurred with those who reduced it to £10,000.
He had moreover acquiesced in the smaller sum by
reason of his faith in the report of the Committee of the
House on the New Inoculation, but he now discovered
that many of the statements in that report were erroneous.
It attested that Vaccination was an infallible preventive
of smallpox, whilst the report of the Surgeons now
admits 56 failures! The first report stated that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
disease followed Vaccination, whilst now it is confessed
that scrofula and other alarming symptoms are its
occasional sequences! The report thus prejudicial to
Vaccination nevertheless argues in its favour, and he
would like to call witnesses to the bar of the House who
would make manifest still further its inconsistencies and
inaccuracies. At this late period of the session, it was
not right to vote away such an amount of public money.
[Such “late periods” are, however, always selected for
jobs.] Besides, it was generally known that Benjamin
Jesty of Worth in Dorsetshire discovered the use of
cowpox long before Jenner, and if the House was
resolved to be liberal, the reward should be shared
with Jesty, or with Jesty’s family. He should oppose
the vote, but he did not say that he would always
do so. His purpose was to gain time for more careful
inquiry.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Petty</span>, who had first moved in the
matter, came to his successor’s support. He had no
doubt as to the efficacy of Vaccination, nor as to Jenner
being its discoverer. His difficulty was to find a rule
for the justice of the case; for whoever considered the
value of the discovery must perceive that it would be
impossible for them to deal generously with the discoverer.
His service to mankind was entirely beyond any financial
estimate. It was objected that Vaccination was not
infallible. He replied that absolute, never-failing perfection
ought not to be expected from any human device:
they should rest well satisfied in the approximation to
infallibility that belonged to Vaccination. Its daily benefits
were numberless. Multitudes of seamen, soldiers,
and citizens of every description had been saved by it,
and in contemplating its future effects on the human
race, the mind was lost in amazement and gratitude.
How then should they presume to talk of liberality
towards Jenner, the benefactor! They should recollect
how he stands in the estimation of the world, how they
were acting in view of all nations, and how their own
characters were at stake in their demeanour towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
him. As to Malthus there was a misapprehension. He
had taught nothing that forbade the extinction of an
infectious disease which so greatly reduced human happiness.
In their concern for Vaccination, the House should
not forget the mischief that was still wrought by inoculation
with smallpox. Zealous as he was for the new
practice, he had no wish to meddle with what others
might imagine (however absurdly) tended to their own
preservation and that of their families, but no one had a
right to endanger the lives of others. It was proved
beyond dispute that those who were inoculated with
smallpox diffused the fatal contagion by going abroad,
or being carried abroad. He thought, therefore, it was
not only the right, but the duty of the State to oblige
those who were infected with smallpox to keep within
doors until complete recovery. He would not move an
amendment to the resolution, but would have no hesitation
in acceding to a larger sum.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Tarleton</span> could not withhold his tribute of
praise from the author of this blessing to mankind. To
his knowledge, it had saved the lives of many in his
Majesty’s service. Soldiers could march and perform
every military duty when under the process of vaccination.
It had been said that gentlemen in the army had
no respect for anything save success in war, but he
thought that many officers knew how to admire Jenner,
the preserver of millions, and to allow that in future
ages his glory would exceed the renown of the greatest
warriors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sturges Bourne</span> denounced the practice of inoculating
out-patients at the Smallpox Hospital whereby
the disease was systematically perpetuated and diffused
throughout the community. He thought the legislature
would be as much justified in taking measures to prevent
this evil by restraint, as a man would be in snatching a
firebrand out of the hands of a maniac just as he was
going to set fire to a city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawkins Browne</span> confessed with shame that he
had voted for £10,000 instead of £20,000 in 1802; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
at that time he little knew the extent of Jenner’s service
to the human race.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Morris</span> did not think that even what
had been said sufficiently set forth their debt of gratitude
to Jenner. His discovery afforded a reasonable expectation
of the extermination of smallpox, and the merit of
the transcendent discovery was all his own. Inoculation
in the old mode mitigated the disease in a few, and
spread it in full fury over many. It was therefore a
curse to mankind instead of a blessing. The Smallpox
Hospital in its practice of inoculation, was a source of
pestilence and a multiplier of victims to this deplorable
distemper. The pre-eminent distinction of Vaccination
was that it preserved its subject and injured no one.
This unspeakable blessing they owed to Jenner, nor had
the least improvement been effected upon his original
and carefully matured prescription. They were bound
to consider how he had abandoned the lucrative pursuit
of his profession, and surrendered many years of his life
for the good of his country and mankind. He would
therefore submit an amendment to the resolution before
the Committee, that the grant be £20,000 instead of
£10,000, to mark their sense of Jenner’s merits and to
place him in a state of independence.</p>

<p>The amendment was warmly supported by Mr. Wilberforce,
Mr. Windham, Sir John Sebright, and Mr.
Herbert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perceval</span>, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, stood
to his resolution, but with indifferent arguments. It
was without precedent that a vote recommended by
Government should be thus increased. He admitted
that Jenner was entitled to much more than they could
afford, but it was also without precedent that so great a
sum as £30,000 (inclusive of the former vote) should be
bestowed on any discoverer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">William Smith</span> would not submit to these objections.
He recited the triumphs of Vaccination in Asia
and America, and said it was true as of old that a prophet
had no honour in his own country. [An observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
singularly inapplicable to Jenner.] He urged the Committee
to vote for the larger sum, and said that whilst
the Chancellor of the Exchequer might in his public
capacity protest, yet in his secret heart he would not be
displeased if overborne by the sentiment of the House, of
the country, and of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitbread</span> begged the Committee to bear in mind
that Jenner had scorned to monopolise Vaccination, and
had thereby sacrificed a great fortune. He called on the
House to vote for the larger sum. Vaccination furnished
the means for lessening the poor rate. Reduced smallpox
signified fewer deaths, fewer orphans, fewer widows.
Vaccination meant better health for the poor and more
money in the pockets of the rich. They would excuse
this appeal of his to the cupidity of the landed interest
inasmuch as he had been anticipated in the exhibition of
loftier considerations. He also wished to relieve the
House from a renewal of this question. Let them reward
Jenner once for all, and liberally: and remember
that what was called economy in this connection, if practised
by the House, would be, in the eye of the world,
their disgrace.</p>

<p>Others spoke in a similar strain, and when the House
divided, 60 voted for Mr. Morris’s amendment, and 47
against it, £20,000 being carried by a majority of 13.
Including the £10,000 voted in 1802, Jenner was thus
awarded £30,000 of public money, in times, too, of war
and scarcity.</p>

<p>The debate, it will be observed, was conducted in a
House of 107 members at a late period of the session,
and the variations among the speakers consisted in
degrees of extravagance and credulity. The fabulous
matter as to Jenner personally affords curious evidence
of the manner in which legends originate in the presence
of contemporaries, and how they come to be repeated
with the fervour of good faith by men whose competence
and honesty might be taken for unimpeachable. Jenner’s
party had whipped up their adherents, and the issue was
sedulously arranged for; but because they had their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
it need not be assumed that it was necessary to circumvent
any active adversaries. Apathy was their chief
difficulty. There was little to be got out of cowpox by
the ordinary politician; and then, as now, the average
M.P. rarely committed himself to any project that did
not obviously make for his popularity. As for the
enthusiasm for Vaccination displayed by the speakers in
the House, we have to recollect that they were not converts
to the practice <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>. No really new discovery
was ever received with such an instant chorus of approbation
by the mob, educated or uneducated. They were
one and all bred under the severe and dangerous practice
of Variolous Inoculation, whereof Vaccination was no
more than a modification with a seductive promise of
equal or greater security from smallpox, and exemption
from its perils and annoyances. Unless this prepossession
be allowed for, the conduct of Parliament toward
Jenner cannot be rightly understood. There was not a
word uttered against Vaccination from the ground which
physiologists at this day occupy, for that ground, in a
scientific sense, was as yet unknown. Smallpox was a
mysterious visitation to be mysteriously dealt with&mdash;dodged,
if possible, by medical artifice; and not, as we
are persuaded, a crisis of impurity in the blood induced
by foul conditions of life, which cannot be better disposed
of than in the course of nature by eruptive fever.
If we could suppress smallpox (in any other way than
by the removal of its causes) we should merely alter its
manifestation and have to accept it in some other and
aggravated form of disease.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">VACCINATION ESTABLISHED AND ENDOWED.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Jenner provided for, his adherents had yet another end
to achieve, namely, their own release from the burden of
the Royal Jennerian Society, paralysed by the secession
of Dr. Walker and the Friends and the establishment of
the London Vaccine Institution. At first they had endeavoured
to discredit the new Institution, even to the
extent of distributing hand-bills like the following in
the streets&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center smcap">A Caution.</p>

<p>To persons desirous of obtaining <span class="smcap">Inoculation</span> for the Cowpox
Gratis under the sanction of</p>

<p class="center smcap">The Royal Jennerian Society.</p>

<p>Whereas, Doctor <span class="smcap">John Walker</span> has, under various pretences,
obstructed persons going to the Central House of this Society, the
Public are hereby warned to be upon their guard against any
insidious representations, the connection between Dr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span> and
the Society having ceased, and Dr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span> having been appointed
the Resident Inoculator at the Society’s House, No. 14 Salisbury
Square.</p>

<p><em>By Order of the Directors and Medical Council, 9th October,
1806.</em></p></div>

<p>It was all in vain. Walker was preferred to Sheridan
Knowles backed by Jenner, whose friends had no liking
for the support of the Society out of their own pockets.
It was therefore planned to resort to Parliament for an
annual subsidy so as dispense with the necessity of subscriptions.
The managers of the London Vaccine Institution,
learning what was on foot, naturally argued that
if Government was to be thus propitious, it was they
who had the better claim to assistance, and therefore
prepared a petition setting forth their exertions in spreading
Vaccine Inoculation. This interference with their
scheme filled the Jennerians with fury, and Mr. <span class="smcap">John
Fuller</span> undertook to speak their mind in the House of
Commons. When, therefore, on 2nd June, 1808, Sir
<span class="smcap">Thomas Turton</span> presented the petition, <span class="smcap">Fuller</span> sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to his feet and denounced it, saying a grosser forgery had
never been submitted to the House.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> interposed. The petition had not been
read. When it was, the House would be enabled to
judge of its contents. Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuller</span> resumed his seat
amid general laughter. The petition having been read&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuller</span> apologised for his abruptness. The petition
was a gross cheat, a wicked trick to swindle the
public; or, if it was not absolute swindling, it went very
near the wind. When they came to solicit his subscription,
he thought they represented some respectable corporation,
but what did they turn out to be? A parcel
of Quakers, or Presbyterians, or whatever else they were
called. They had got five guineas from him, but the
moment he detected them, he threatened them with a
Bow Street officer and a charge of swindling, which soon
frightened them into a re-delivery of his money. What
a shame it was to see the cause of such fellows espoused
by any man in that House! He did not suppose the
Honourable Baronet shared in their gains, and he might
laugh as he pleased, and spout like a lawyer, but it was
a poor way to show himself off for the sake of a little
notoriety among such despicable sectaries. He hoped the
House would not lend any countenance to the imposture.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Turton</span> good humouredly replied, that
the Jennerian Society, in whose interest the preceding
speaker exhibited so much untempered zeal, was not
instituted till 1803. The original Vaccine Pock Institution
was established by Dr. Pearson in 1799. The
Institution to which the petition referred was established
in 1806, chiefly by members of the Society of Friends, a
sect to whose virtuous principles and behaviour it was
his privilege to bear testimony. Since 1806 the Institution
had communicated the vaccine matter to 81,000
persons in every situation of life. The petitioners only
desired to have the facts they adduced inquired into, and
hoped for public aid only in the event of being entitled
to it on public grounds.</p>

<p>This application for assistance by Walker’s Institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
rendered its concession to the Jennerian Society impossible:
it was not for the Government to get into hot
water by showing favour to either; and as both could
not be subsidised, it was determined to vary the application,
and to ask the House of Commons to provide
means for the maintenance of a new and independent
institution from which “the Genuine Vaccine Virus could
be distributed without expense throughout the British
dominions.” Mr. <span class="smcap">George Rose</span>, Treasurer to the Navy,
took charge of the measure, which he introduced to the
House on 9th June, 1808. After dealing with a notorious
failure of Vaccination at Ringwood, he proceeded to
observe, that whilst it could no longer be said that
Vaccination was a certain security against Smallpox in
all cases, yet the evidence showed that the failures were
not one in 300. He would therefore move that the
House having the testimony of the Colleges of Physicians
and Surgeons of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, that
Vaccination was salutary and generally effective, it is
desirable that a Central Institution be formed for the
provision and distribution of Real Vaccine Matter, and
that its administration be committed to the Royal
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in London. The
expense would not be more than £2500 or £3000 per
annum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davies Giddy</span> said he should not oppose the
resolution, but it would have been much better to have
refrained from interference. The people would neglect
inoculation, and then smallpox would break out with
tenfold severity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fuller</span> observed that Smallpox had been annihilated
in Calcutta by systematic and enforced Vaccination,
and he believed the same result was attainable in this
country. He thought that even those who hesitated to
resort to general compulsion, would not object to the
Vaccination of all children in workhouses.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">T. Turton</span> would have preferred a committee of
investigation. There were already three Institutions in
London for the express purpose of propagating cowpox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and the object Mr. Rose had in view was more likely to
be attained by private subscriptions and by assistance
from Government than by a special Institution formed
and endowed by the State.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Henry Petty</span> contended that as the evidence
was now confessedly incomplete as to the infallible
efficacy of Vaccination, it was highly proper that investigation
should be persevered in under the eye of
the public instead of by a number of small institutions
which were not perhaps altogether exempt from the
imputation of being guided by mercenary motives.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Burdett</span> said Vaccination appeared before
them with a complexion widely differing from that originally
assumed. A short time ago they were assured it was
an infallible preventive of Smallpox, and that its practice
was so simple that any old woman was equal to it. Now
they were told that it was a very nice operation requiring
great judgment and skill, the want of which was held to
account for the many failures which had occurred. Thus
there was neither that simplicity nor security which was
originally asserted. Considering these manifest discrepancies
between promise and practice, it was, he thought,
most unwise for the House to intervene in order to help
what appeared to be a failing experiment. They ought
to be cautious&mdash;they ought not to prop up what might
prove to be pernicious error. Government in this free
country cannot compel people to submit to the prescriptions
of physicians, or the operations of surgeons, or
anything except the laws; and it was doubtful whether
science itself would be benefitted if placed under Government
direction. They were referred to the reports of
the Medical Colleges, but as he read these reports he
detected much hesitation and evasion, and anything but
the assurance displayed on behalf of Vaccination by
several members of the House. Many instances of failure
were admitted, and such instances might safely be
doubled. As for Spurious Cowpox he wished to know
what it was. It was used to account for all mishaps,
and it was, he suspected, a mere shift, shuffle, and get-off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
[Sir Francis need not have spoken thus dubiously, for the
Report of the Physicians admitted what he suspected.]
He would much prefer a committee of investigation, and
hoped the resolution would not be pressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span> brought up the foreign argument.
There might be failures at home, but these could be satisfactorily
accounted for. It was for them to consider the
magnificent successes of Vaccination in other lands [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne
ignotum pro magnifico est</i>], concerning which there was
no room for doubt. He saw no surer method of inspiring
the public with confidence in Vaccination than by the
establishment of the proposed Institution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rose</span> explained that he merely wished to bring
the House to a resolution, leaving it to his Majesty [that
was to say, himself for the Government] to give it effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George Canning</span>, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, declared that though he considered the discovery of
Vaccination to be of the greatest importance, yet he could
not imagine any circumstances whatever that would induce
him to follow up the most favourable report of its
infallibility with any measure for its compulsory infliction.</p>

<p>This declaration of Canning is well worth attention
and commemoration. It serves to mark the reverence
for personal liberty, which was the fine distinction of
the former order of English statesmen, and separated,
when little else did, the English from the Continental
Tory. The noble tradition of this liberty meets with
scant favour in these times, and Canning’s avowal in the
new House of Commons would be heard as an anachronism.
Nearly every adventurer who has a prescription
for the moral and physical welfare of his fellow creatures
hopes to have it enforced by legislation; and since, under
penalty of fine and imprisonment, our babes are cut and
poisoned to save them from smallpox, there is no infraction
of personal liberty, however outrageous, that can
now be pronounced impossible.</p>

<p>When the House divided there were 60 for the motion
and 5 against it&mdash;again a small House for so critical a
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>With the permission to spend £3000 a year, the
National Vaccine Establishment was constituted, Jenner
being consulted in its organisation. A Board was formed,
consisting of the President and four Censors of the Royal
College of Physicians, and the Master and two senior
Wardens of the College of Surgeons. The Board met on
8th December, 1808, and proceeded to business. Jenner,
as was his fatality on important occasions, was absent,
being detained at Berkeley by family affliction. He
wrote to Moore&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should be unworthy of the name of father were I to stir from
my children. Indeed, nothing would make me, not even a royal
mandate, unless accompanied by a troop of horse.</p></div>

<p>Jenner was elected Director, but not a member of the
Board, and immediately began to protest that he was
disregarded and subjected to indignity. “The Board,”
he said, “appointed me Director, but they soon contrived
to let me feel that I was to be a Director <em>directed</em>.” The
arrangement he had made with Mr. Rose and Sir Lucas
Pepys, the President of the College of Physicians, was,
he held, altogether different&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was stipulated between Mr. Rose, Sir Lucas, and myself, that
no person should take any part in the Vaccinating Department
who was not either nominated by me or submitted to my approbation.
On my reminding Sir Lucas of this, he replied, “You, Sir,
are to be whole and sole Director. We [meaning the Board] are
to be considered as nothing. What do <em>we</em> know of Vaccination.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></div>

<p>Sir Lucas of course was jeering, but Jenner’s head was
so turned with vanity and flattery that he could not
distinguish mockery from sincerity. He had constructed
for himself a fool’s paradise, out of which the Board
pitched him unceremoniously. He recommended his
bludgeon bearer, John Ring, for Chief Vaccinator and
Inspector of Stations, but the Board declined to have
anything to do with him, and added insult to contempt;
for in Jenner’s words, written in the third person&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They appointed a gentleman in his place who was taken from an
Institution which had been personally hostile to Dr. Jenner on all
occasions.</p></div>

<p>Subsequently he sent in a list of seven names for Sub-Vaccinators,
of which the Board rejected five, which
brought matters to a crisis, and he resigned. In the
memorandum, from which I have quoted, he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the whole of these circumstances, Dr. Jenner felt himself
under the necessity of withdrawing from the establishment. He
could take upon himself no responsibility where he had no power,
not even a vote. He did not wish to control the establishment;
nothing was further from his thoughts. But he expected that the
practical part of its concerns would have been under his direction,
as the title of his office implied; and he expected that those gentlemen
whom, from a consciousness of their pre-eminent ability, he
had so strongly recommended to conduct this practical part, would
have been appointed. But as his recommendations have been
disregarded&mdash;as arrangements and appointments have been made
which are contrary to his judgment, and as he is informed by the
Board that it was intended for them to use their own discretion,
and that they alone are responsible for the conduct of the establishment,
Dr. Jenner declined accepting the station of Director, to
which they had nominated him, since he found that he was to have
nothing to do in the establishment, and that his office was only a
name.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p></div>

<p>To those who did not know Jenner, or who accepted
him at his own estimate, the treatment to which he was
subjected might appear reprehensible; but the Board
understood their man, and only cared to have the benefit
of his name, for little else was worth having. What
could be made of a character indolent and untrustworthy;
who disliked London and was off to Gloucestershire on
any pretext; whose sickly family had from him the
supreme consideration of an affectionate mother! He
wrote to Moore&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I agree with you that my not being a member of the British
Vaccine Establishment will astonish the world; and no one in it
can be more astonished than myself.</p></div>

<p>He was mistaken. The world, so far as it thought at
all, considered he was handsomely rewarded with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
£30,000, and with so much public money in his pocket
might have looked for a better disposition on his part.
When his nominations were disregarded, he declined even
to come to London, and thus excused his sulking at
Berkeley&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was quite in earnest at the time I informed you of my intention
to come to town, but while I was getting things in order there
came a piece of information from a Right Hon. Gentleman which
determined me to remain in my retirement. It was as follows&mdash;</p>

<p><em>That the Institution was formed for the purpose of a full and
satisfactory investigation of the benefits or dangers of the Vaccine
Practice, and that this was the reason why Dr. Jenner could not
be admitted as one of the conductors of it, as the public would not
have the same confidence in their proceedings as if the Board were
left to their own judgment in doubtful cases.</em></p>

<p>This is the sum and substance of the communication&mdash;</p>

<p>What do we know of Vaccination?</p>

<p>We know nothing of Vaccination!</p>

<p>Alas! poor Vaccinia, how art thou degraded!</p>

<p>You intimated something of this sort to me some time since, and
now I get it from the fountain head. An institution founded on
the principle of inquiry seven or eight years ago, would have been
worthy of the British nation; but now, after the whole world
bears testimony to the safety and efficacy of the Vaccine Practice,
I do think it a most extraordinary proceeding. It is one that
must necessarily degrade me, and cannot exalt the framers of it in
the eyes of common-sense. I shall now stick closely to <em>my own
Institution</em>, which I have the pride and vanity to think is paramount
to all others, as its extent and benefits are boundless. Of
this I am the real and not the nominal Director. I have conducted
the whole concern for no inconsiderable number of years, single-handed,
and have spread Vaccination round the globe. This
convinces me that simplicity in this, as in all effective machinery,
is best.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p></div>

<p>In the discussion in the House of Commons it was
stated by his friend, Lord Henry Petty, that one of the
objects of the Establishment would be investigation, and
it was absurd for Jenner to pretend that the fact came
upon him as a revelation; and, unless completely blinded
by conceit, he must have recognised that the general
faith in Vaccination exhibited in 1801 had been much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
shaken by the experience of the succeeding seven years.
But it is idle to argue the matter. When Jenner could
say that he single-handed had conducted the whole concern
for years and spread Vaccination round the globe,
he could assert anything. The letter is interesting chiefly
as an exhibition of character.</p>

<p>We shall return to the National Vaccine Establishment
and its management&mdash;a curious story. Suffice it for the
present to observe, that its immediate effects were adverse
to Vaccination. The annual endowment was consumed
in salaries, and many ceased to subscribe to the Cowpox
Societies since Vaccination was so well provided for.
The essential mischief consisted in the recognition of the
evil practice by the State, whereby it has been perpetuated
to the common injury to our own day.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">THE ORIGINAL VACCINE POCK INSTITUTION.</h4>

<p>The national endowment of Vaccination afforded a
convenient pretext for closing this Institution, founded
by Dr. Pearson and his friends in 1799; but some said the
true reason was involved in the following resolutions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap padr2">Vaccine Pock Institution,</span><br />
Broad Street, Golden Square.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Quarterly Court</span>, Nov. 5, 1805.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>&mdash;That according to the experience of the medical establishment
of this Institution, it appears that the Inoculation for the
Cowpock affords security against the Smallpox equally with Variolous
Inoculation, and that the new practice possesses all the advantages
already stated to the public.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>&mdash;That, in order to give a further proof to the public,
and to afford an inducement for information adverse to the new
practice, the following proposal be made public, viz.:&mdash;That, in
future, every patient who shall be vaccinated at this Institution,
on discharge, shall receive a Certificate, stating that such patient
has gone through the Cowpock, and engaging that if hereafter the
said patient shall take the Smallpox, he or she shall be entitled to
the sum of Five Guineas, to be paid from the funds of this Institution
at the first General Court, after the proofs have been given,
according to the rules of the medical establishment.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Sancho</span>, <em>Secretary</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The offer attested the sincerity of the conductors of
the Institution, but so many patients, it is said, laid claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to Five Guineas that it was not without satisfaction that
a reasonable cause was afforded for shutting up.</p>

<p>Dr. Pearson held that it was impossible to be re-vaccinated.
He argued that since no one could have Smallpox
twice, no one could have the equivalent of Smallpox,
namely Cowpox, twice. It was a logical contention;
but facts did not correspond to the logic. Pearson also
objected to the Variolous Test, or inoculation with Smallpox
after inoculation with Cowpox to prove that the
constitution was fortified against attack. He preferred
Cowpox to Smallpox for the purpose, as milder and less
liable to dangerous results. He found that after Cowpox
it was impossible to have Cowpox&mdash;at least immediately.
Hence he was confirmed in his opinion that Cowpox
after Cowpox was impossible; just as others argued on
the same grounds that Smallpox after Cowpox was impossible.
Yet at this day none doubt that Pearson was
in error; for all believe in the possibility of re-Vaccination,
or Cowpox after Cowpox; likewise of Smallpox
after Cowpox.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">HORSEGREASE AS A SOURCE OF VACCINE.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">In order to complete the account of Jenner’s awards and
the adoption of Vaccination by Parliament, I have passed
over several matters of interest and significance, which I
shall now proceed to deal with, commencing with the
tactics of our hero in relation to Horsegrease.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Inquiry</cite>, published in 1798, Jenner set forth
Horsegrease as the origin of that form of Cowpox, which,
when inoculated on the human subject, ensured life-long
security from Smallpox. Many attempts were consequently
made to produce pox on the teats of cows by
inoculating them with Horsegrease, but in vain; and the
possibility became discredited. Moreover, the notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
inoculation with Horsegrease, either immediately or
through the cow, was disliked intensely. It was pronounced
repulsive. Why virus from horses’ heels should
be more repulsive than virus from cows’ teats was not
explained; but, as we know, there is no accounting for
tastes. Many who eat beef with relish would start with
disgust from horse-flesh. A story is told of a Wesleyan
who rebuked a sister for wearing feathers in her hat,
and was sharply referred to the existence of flowers in
her own. “Yes, sister dear,” was the cogent reply, “but
we must draw the line somewhere, and it is drawn at
feathers.” The line was drawn at Horsegrease, and the
origin of Cowpox as asserted by Jenner and his country
acquaintance was conveniently denied. Jenner was not
slow to perceive how the wind of opinion was blowing,
and let Horsegrease drop. He said not a word about it
in his petition to Parliament in 1802, nor did he again
advance it as a reason for consideration.</p>

<p>Now, why was this? Was it because he had ceased
to believe that Cowpox originated in Horsegrease? Not
at all! Why, then, did he not vindicate his opinion and
confront vulgar prejudice? Simply because he had the
wit to discern, that whilst he might get something out of
the national purse for the Cowpox recipe, he could get
nothing for the Horsegrease one. As Dr. Pearson observed,
“The very name of Horsegrease was like to have
wrecked the whole concern”&mdash;an observation that Dr.
Mason Good confirms in saying, “The mere idea of using
the matter of grease from the horse’s heel excited from
the first so deep and extensive a disgust that Cowpox
Inoculation had nearly fallen a sacrifice from the supposed
union of the two diseases.”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that I am censuring Jenner as
a tradesman.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> If any of us had two patents for sale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
we should be great fools if we declined to take £30,000
for one without the other, or suffered one to prejudice
the other, or tried to inflict any doctrine about them
upon the purchaser. It is for those who go to market to
adapt themselves to the market, and remember that
sellers were made for buyers, and not buyers for sellers.
Since then the public were ready to pay for Cowpox,
whilst they shuddered at Horsegrease, it was not for
Jenner to force Horsegrease upon them.</p>

<p>Such is mercantile logic; and on its own conditions it
is irrefragable; but it is not the custom to deal with
Jenner as a tradesman, but as a man of science, and to
range him with great discoverers, inventors, and benefactors
of mankind; and here it is that I decidedly
demur. What, I ask, did he discover? He did not
discover that Cowpox prevented Smallpox: that was the
dairy-maids’ faith. He did not discover that Horsegrease
prevented Smallpox: that was the farriers’ faith.
He did not discover that Horsegrease on milkers’ hands
begot pox on cows’ teats: that was the farmers’ belief.
He did not discover that inoculated virus could be conveyed
from arm to arm: that was an existing practice.
What then did he discover? He discovered nothing.
He did no more than take the vulgar opinion of his
neighbourhood to the London market. He made a few
perfunctory experiments by way of confirmation, advertised
them in a book, and by good or ill luck the notion
was caught up, and worked to practical issues, chiefly by
Pearson, who thereby incurred the full malignity of
Jenner’s jealousy.</p>

<p>The distinction between a man of science and a tradesman
is this, that the mind of the one is set on the
extraction of truth and the other on the extraction of
profit. The man of science does not inquire what the
public may be pleased to know and pay for, but he
ascertains and defines what is fact, and leaves the public
to adjust themselves thereto as they may find convenient.
If they recognise the truth communicated, it is well for
them; if they dislike or deny the truth, it is ill for them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
but well or ill, the man of science is the disinterested
expositor of what he knows to be true; not unfrequently,
when his revelation vitally affronts popular prejudice,
realising the blessing of those who are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake.</p>

<p>What therefore I maintain concerning Jenner is, that the
truth (as we may presume he regarded it) he did not fully
reveal; that what he did reveal, he suffered to be derided
and denied; that he was content to take credit for so
much of it as was marketable; whilst his private conviction
about Horsegrease remained unaffected, not only
in theory, but in deliberate practice.</p>

<p>It is for me to establish these assertions.</p>

<p>First, I say, he did not fully reveal what he knew.
In 1789 Jenner inoculated his son, Edward, an infant of
18 months, not with Cowpox, or with Horsegrease, but
with Swinepox; and, according to the evidence of his
own papers, the result was perfectly satisfactory. The
child was subsequently inoculated with Smallpox on five
or six different occasions, and always without effect.
According to the well-known variolous test, he was proof
against Smallpox. In short, there was nothing that
Jenner ever adduced in favour of Cowpox that was not
equally valid of Swinepox. And this Swinepox experiment
was made nearly ten years prior to his advertisement
of Cowpox and Horsegrease. Why, I ask, did he
keep back the truth about Swinepox? When Cowpox
was scarce, and every cow-house was explored for virus,
why did he not recommend Swinepox as an alternative?
Why, too, did he refrain from the obvious generalisation,
that Cowpox, Horsegrease, Swinepox, and probably other
sorts of pox, generated fevers, during the prevalence of
which inoculation with Smallpox was not apt to take?
The answer is plain, Because he had something to sell
rather than something to teach.</p>

<p>In conformity with this conduct he suffered the origin
of Cowpox in Horsegrease, and the specific virtue of
grease to be derided and denied. “It was fortunate for
Dr. Jenner, and the triumph of his discovery,” wrote Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Mason Good, “that a minuter attention to the subject
gave sufficient proof that there was no foundation for his
opinion that Cowpox originated in Horsegrease, nor that
any connection existed between the diseases.”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Such
was the convenient medical verdict, which Jenner did
not venture to disturb, though all the while persuaded of
its error. There were failures to inoculate cows with
Horsegrease, but Thomas Tanner, veterinary surgeon, of
Rockhampton, Gloucestershire, “had the merit,” says Dr.
Baron, “of proving the truth of Jenner’s statement.”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
He succeeded in communicating the disease to the cow
from the heel of the horse, producing on the cow’s teat a
complete vaccine pustule. “From handling the cow’s
teats,” said Tanner, “I became myself infected and had
two pustules on my hand, which brought on inflammation,
and made me unwell for several days. The matter
from the cow, and from my own hand, proved efficacious
in infecting both human subjects and cattle.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Jenner
distributed the virus from Tanner, and it operated precisely
like Cowpox. But the proof did not rest with
Tanner: others repeated his experiment with similar
issues. Dr. Loy of Whitby published in 1801 <cite>Some
Observations on the Origin of the Cowpox</cite>, in which
he confirmed Jenner’s country tales, and described how
(dispensing with the cow) he managed to inoculate
patients with Horsegrease, producing pustules identical
with those from Cowpox, and subjecting the persons
thus equinated to the variolous test with complete
impunity. Yet, with so much to fortify him, Jenner
kept silent. He preferred to be adjudged mistaken
rather than risk the forfeit of public favour and pay.
Nor might I blame him, had he frankly reasserted the
integrity of the Gloucestershire faith, and allowed that
since the public were ready to accept Cowpox without
Horsegrease, it was not for him to stand in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
their preference by an obstinate defence of what was
non-essential in practice.</p>

<p>But the case for Horsegrease was yet stronger than I have
stated. Dr. Sacco of Milan was sometimes described as
“the prince of vaccinators” by reason of his enthusiasm,
his professional attainments, and the facilities that were
accorded to him in the Cisalpine Republic of those days
for universal vaccination. He tried to generate pox on
the cow with grease from the horse, but failed, and in
1801 reported to Jenner his failure. In 1803, however,
he cried, Eureka! A coachman presented himself at the
Milan Hospital suffering from an eruption contracted in
grooming a horse with greasy heels. He was at once led
off by Sacco to the Foundling Asylum, where nine children
were inoculated from the vesicles on his hands. On
three of the children the inoculation took, producing
vesicles which were pronounced to be the same as those
resulting from Cowpox. The virus was propagated from
arm to arm, and distributed in all directions. Dr. Sacco
from thenceforth avowed himself a Horsegreaser. “It
is now admitted and settled,” he wrote to Jenner from
Milan, 25th March, 1803, “that grease is the cause of
vaccine, and we cannot too soon alter the designation to
equine.”</p>

<p>Was the designation changed to equine? It was not,
nor was the attempt made. Those chiefly concerned in
promoting vaccination in England would not hear of
Horsegrease, and many were ready to swear that in the
matter of pox, the horse and the cow had no connection
whatever, and that Jenner had too hastily assumed the
truth of a vulgar west country opinion.</p>

<p>Dr. De Carro of Vienna, who described himself as
Jenner’s friend and first apostle, having effected the
first vaccination on the Continent and transmitted the
first charge of vaccine to India, was also a Horsegreaser.
Whilst Jenner was judiciously holding his tongue about
Horsegrease in England, he wrote to De Carro congratulating
him on his success in conveying Cowpox to
the East, and ascribing the failure of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
attempts to the absurd prejudice against Horsegrease,
which Dr. Loy had, however, completely annihilated.
Here are his words under date, 28th March, 1803&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am confident that had not the opponents of my ideas of the
origin of the disease been so absurdly clamorous, particularly the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par nobile fratrum</i> [Pearson and Woodville], the Asiatics would
long since have enjoyed the blessings of Vaccination, and many a
victim been rescued from an untimely grave. The decisive experiments
of Dr. Loy have silenced the tongues of these gentlemen
for ever.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></div>

<p>How the clamorous opposition to Horsegrease had
deprived Hindoos of the earlier blessing of vaccination,
we are left to conjecture. Perhaps he meant that Horsegrease
would have borne transit to India better than
Cowpox, or that the Hindoos themselves might have
resorted to horses with greasy heels.</p>

<p>In reply, 22nd April, 1803, De Carro wrote to Jenner
commending his moderation in maintaining silence toward
his antagonists&mdash;little apprehending the motives
of that silence. Pearson’s conduct, he thought, bordered
on insanity. “I am extremely glad,” he continued,
“that you have treated it with the contempt it deserves,
though I am happy to see that your friends have exposed
his ridiculous and malevolent designs.”</p>

<p>De Carro was intimate with Sacco of Milan, and from
him received virus derived from Horsegrease, which he
used indiscriminately with Cowpox, until in Vienna it
was unknown who were vaccinated and who equinated.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>De Carro was also in correspondence with Dr. La
Font, a French physician, established at Salonica, who
was likewise a Horsegreaser. He discovered that the
Macedonian farriers recognised three sorts of grease in
horses, called in general <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">javart</i>, and discriminated as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’écrouelleux, le phlegmoneux, et la variolique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> With
the variolous grease, La Font inoculated two boys, and
from them other children, reproducing the experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Loy of Whitby and Sacco of Milan. De Carro in communicating
La Font’s success to Jenner, 21st June, 1803,
observed, “These particulars, I hope, will silence all
those who still doubt the truth of your doctrine as to
the connection of Grease, Cowpox, and Smallpox”&mdash;Jenner
holding that Smallpox was a malignant variety
of Cowpox, whilst Cowpox came out of Horsegrease.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these confirmations and his boast
that the opposition of Pearson and Woodville was silenced
for ever, Jenner suffered judgment to go against him.
He recognised that it was expedient that the connection
between Horsegrease and Cowpox should be denied. He
had his bill to settle with the English public, and it was
not for him to make difficulties. A curious evidence of
how thoroughly the unpopular truth was suppressed is
furnished by Dr. Willan’s treatise <cite>On Vaccine Inoculation</cite>,
published in 1806. There is not a word or hint in
it concerning Horsegrease. The treatise was the work
of a competent physician, who set forth what was known
of vaccination (from the standpoint of belief) with fulness
and clearness, accompanied with an appendix of
letters and reports from Jenner himself, from Pearson
and other experts in the new practice&mdash;but as to Horsegrease,
the silence was absolute. How the disagreeable
truth was so effectually covered up is more than I can
account for. It was not mentioned in the debates in
Parliament, nor was it referred to in the reports of the
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, nor did the opponents
of vaccination use it with the force that might
have been expected. One explanation is, that Jenner’s
<cite>Inquiry</cite> never entered into general circulation, that no
popular edition ever appeared, and that it was chiefly
known at second hand. The leading representatives of
vaccination, moreover, so boldly disowned Horsegrease
and Jenner’s authority in ascribing Cowpox to its parentage,
that there was little use in charging them with
it; whilst all the while Jenner offered no open resistance
to those who contemned him for one mistake, but exhausted
the language of adulation on his imputed merit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Thus we suppose it came to pass that at the end of
twenty years Dr. Mason Good, as the exponent of orthodox
medical faith, felt justified in asserting that
there was no foundation for the opinion that Cowpox
originated in Horsegrease, nor that any connection existed
between the diseases, and that it was fortunate for
Jenner and the triumph of his discovery that the fact
was so.</p>

<p>Jenner was silenced, but was he convinced? How
could he be convinced? Horsegrease as the origin of
Cowpox might be voted detestable and impossible, but
there was the evidence of the country folk, confirmed
by Tanner, Loy, Sacco, De Carro, and La Font; and
though a weak man may be put down, or think it worth
while to be accounted mistaken, yet, in the stillness of
his mind, he knows that facts are facts whatever may
be said to the contrary. When, therefore, Jenner had
filled his purse, obtaining all he could expect from public
favour, and was clear of London, and the oppression of
its savants, he reverted to his first opinion as true&mdash;true
and untrue, true with a distinction, which I shall presently
define. Writing to James Moore, Director of the
National Vaccine Establishment, from Berkeley, on 23rd
July, 1813, he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You seem not perfectly satisfied that the origin of vaccine is
clearly made out. For my part, I should think that Loy’s experiments
were sufficient to establish it, to say nothing of Sacco’s and
others on the Continent. However, I have now fresh evidence,
partly foreign and partly domestic. The latter comes from Mr.
Melon, a surgeon of repute at Lichfield. He has sent me some of
his equine virus, which I have been using from arm-to-arm for two
months past, without observing the smallest deviation in the progress
and appearance of the pustules from those produced by the
vaccine.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p></div>

<p>And in a subsequent note of 1st August, he repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Moore</span>,&mdash;I have been constantly equinating for some
months, and perceive not the smallest difference between the
pustules thus produced and the vaccine. Both are alike, because
they come from the same source.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>To Moore again he wrote from Cheltenham, 27th
October, 1813&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sorry you have not succeeded in infecting a cow. I have
told you before <em>that the matter which flows from the fissures in
the horse’s heels will do nothing</em>. [Note the observation placed in
italics.] The virus is contained in vesicles on the edges and the
surrounding skin.</p>

<p>Did I ever inform you of the curious result of vaccinating carters?
From their youth these men have the care of horses used for ploughing
our corn lands; and great numbers have come to me from the
hills to be vaccinated, but the half have proved insusceptible. On
inquiry, many of them have recollected having sores on their hands
and fingers from dressing horses affected with sore heels, and being
so ill as to be disabled from work; and on several of their hands,
I have found the cicatrix as perfect and characteristically marked
as if it had arisen from my own vaccination.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p></div>

<p>Then we have a memorandum of Jenner’s, dated 1st
April, 1817, wherein he thus traces the course of the
virus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rise and progress of the equine matter from the farm of Allen at
Wansell. From a horse to Allen; from Allen to two or three of
his milch cows; from the cows to James Cole, a young man who
milked at the farm; from James Cole to John Powell by inoculation
from a vesicle on the hand of Cole; and to Anne Powell, an
infant; from Powell to Samuel Rudder; from Rudder to Sophia
Orpin, and to Henry Martin; from H. Martin to Elizabeth Martin.
All this went on with perfect regularity for eight months, when
the virus became intermixed with other matter, so that no journal
was kept afterwards. Proof was obtained of the patients being
duly protected<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Which was to say, that they were subsequently inoculated
with Smallpox without effect. Among Jenner’s papers,
there were other entries to the same purpose, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>17th May, 1817.</em>&mdash;Took matter from Jane King (equine direct)
for the National Vaccine Establishment. The pustules beautifully
correct.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p></div>

<p>This equine virus from Jane King was extensively
diffused. It was, we see, sent to London; it was also
sent to Edinburgh;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and Dr. Baron says he had supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of it for use in the Gloucester Infirmary. Baron relates
that in the following year he was able to return the gift,
having obtained virus from the hands of a boy infected
directly from the horse. Here is Jenner’s acknowledgment
of the present, dated 25th April, 1818&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Dear Baron,&mdash;Yesterday H. Shrapnell brought me the equine
virus and your drawing, which conveys so good an idea of the
disease, that no one who has seen it can doubt that the vesicles
contain the true and genuine life-preserving fluid. I have inserted
some of it into a child’s arm; but I shall be vexed if some of your
young men at the Infirmary have not done the same with the fluid
fresh from the boy’s hand.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p></div>

<p>It is surely unnecessary to adduce further evidence of
what was Jenner’s mature faith and deliberate practice.
Further, it is manifest that to the end of his career he
held that pox in the cow was not only derived from
grease in the horse, but that it was exclusively derived
from the horse, and, that apart from the horse, Cowpox
would cease to exist. Owing to the multiplication of vaccination
failures, it began to be conjectured that vaccine
might be worn out by transmission from arm-to-arm,
and that a reversion to the cow might be expedient;
and discussing the question in a letter to Moore, dated
5th March, 1816, Jenner advanced the objection&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If there were a real necessity for a renovation, I know not what
we should do; for the precautions of the farmers with respect to
their horses have driven the Cowpox from their herds.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></div>

<p>Why did not Moore rejoin, Where is the difficulty?
Suppose pox driven from the herds, what conceivable
reason was there for anxiety when the cow had become
a demonstrated superfluity?&mdash;when, in Jenner’s own
words, “the true and genuine life-preserving fluid”
might be drawn direct from horses’ heels? Except for
the perpetuation of imposture, the cow in the case had
ceased to have any value whatever. But, as so often
happens with quacks, their minds become so saturated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with their own humbug that there is nothing left of
common-sense.</p>

<p>Having thus proved my assertions concerning Jenner,
it may be reasonably asked, How was it that some got
Cowpox by means of Horsegrease when others could
not? for, it may be argued, that if Cowpox issued straight
and invariably from inoculated Horsegrease, not even
the most resolute prejudice against Horsegrease could
have permanently kept back the truth.</p>

<p>The answer is, that Cowpox never came out of what is
commonly known as Horsegrease. The statement made
by Jenner in his <cite>Inquiry</cite> of 1798 that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The limpid fluid which issues from the small cracks or fissures
in the inflamed and swollen horse’s heel&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">infected cows and begot pox was a blunder, which he
explicitly reversed fifteen years afterwards in his letter
to Moore of 27th October, 1813, already cited&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sorry [he wrote] you have not succeeded in infecting a
cow. I have told you before that the matter which flows from the
fissures in the horse’s heel will do nothing. It is contained in
vesicles and the surrounding skin.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner, we have always to remember, was a slovenly
investigator, not apt to take pains, but apt to eke out
observation with invention. His friend, “honest Jack
Baron of Gloucester,” who himself inoculated with horse
virus unmodified by the cow, actually wrote Jenner’s life
in two volumes, and not until the work was ready for
the binder did he discover that he was in error in common
with his master in ascribing Cowpox to Horsegrease!
Such was the intellectual muddle in which these prophets
of vaccination operated! In a note stuck at the end of
the second volume, we have the following amazing confession,
made, remember, in 1838, fifteen years after the
chief conjurer’s death&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing my regret that I have employed
the word <em>Grease</em> in alluding to the disease in the horse.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Variolæ Equinæ</i> is the proper designation. It has no necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
connection with the <em>Grease</em>, though the disorders frequently co-exist.
This circumstance at first misled Dr. Jenner, and it has
caused much misapprehension and confusion.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p></div>

<p>Here we have the secret and desired explanation. It
was out of Horsepox, and not out of Horsegrease, that
Cowpox was derived, and in confounding grease with
pox, Jenner mystified himself and others, and obscured
the whole doctrine of vaccination. The Macedonian
farriers who in 1803 informed La Font that they recognised
three sorts of grease, and one of them variolous,
were more accurate observers than the Gloucestershire
farriers and farmers whose opinion Jenner lazily retailed.
Whether he had any clear apprehension of his own
blunder is not apparent. We have seen how long it
took his biographer, Baron, to find it out. This is certain,
that he made no public attempt to set right what
he had so egregiously set wrong, nor to withdraw the
statement in his <cite>Inquiry</cite> that Horsegrease only acquired
its efficacy against Smallpox after inoculation on the cow.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may inquire what is the present state of
opinion as to Horsegrease and Cowpox? When difficult
questions are asked, we usually turn to our cyclopædias,
and taking down Hooper’s <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lexicon Medicum</cite>, 8th ed.
1848, Art. Cowpox, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now ascertained that the horse and the cow each furnish,
independently of the other, a virus capable of communicating
genuine Cowpox to the human subject.</p></div>

<p>Genuine Cowpox communicated by a horse is surely a
bull of the first magnitude! The <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>,
8th ed. 1860, Art. Vaccination, illuminates us
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now to be regarded as an established fact, that Horsegrease
and Cowpox are the same complaint, modified by the constitution
of the animals in which they occur.</p></div>

<p>An established fact, indeed!&mdash;established in quicksand!</p>

<p>Some say the Gloucestershire farmers and Jenner
were correct in attributing Cowpox to Horsegrease, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
that they can only he charged with mistake in nomenclature.
When they said Horsegrease, they meant
Horsepox, not discriminating between maladies that
sometimes occurred together. No one now believes that
the affection recognised by veterinarians as “grease”
ever originated Cowpox. The same rural authorities,
including Jenner, held that where there was no Horsepox,
there could be no Cowpox; but, so far as I can
make out, that conclusion is surrendered. Pox on the
horse may generate pox on the cow, but the cow may
have pox without the horse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this respect only was Jenner in error [says Mr. George
Fleming, Army Veterinary Inspector]. The two diseases are
perfectly independent of each other. Cowpox appears where
there are no horses, or possible contact with horses; and may
affect a number of cows in a dairy while the horses are entirely
free from Horsepox.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p></div>

<p>At this point comes the tug of war. If cows have
pox, how do they contract the malady? Speaking at
the London Conference on Animal Vaccination in December,
1879, Professor J. B. Simonds, Principal of the
Royal Veterinary College, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My contention is, that the existence of Cowpox has to be proved.
Jenner’s account of the disease was an illusion. In my experience
among animals for forty years, I have never seen a case of Cowpox,
and I do not believe that any form of variola belongs to the
bovine race. Sheep are afflicted with pox, but not cattle. We
hear of Cowpox, but who ever heard of Bullpox? And is it
credible that a disease should be confined to cows and never attack
bulls and steers? Let any one point out an affection of females
that does not extend to the males of the same species.</p></div>

<p>Professor Simonds and others believe that Cowpox as
described by Jenner was a parasitic affection of Smallpox,
probably communicated by milkers; and that
Ceely, Badcock, and others did intentionally, what
milkers had done inadvertently, when they inoculated
cattle with Smallpox in order to create virus for vaccination.
On the other hand, those who assert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
independent existence of Cowpox, hold no terms with
this heresy. As Dr. Cameron says, “We can no more
make Smallpox into Cowpox than by stunting an oak-tree
we can make it a gooseberry bush.” Fortunately I
have no call to pronounce judgment on the controversy.
The more it rages, the better I like it, and if the combatants
disposed of each other as did the Kilkenny cats,
I might not be very sorry.</p>

<p>A last word as to Horsepox. There seems to be little
doubt that when inoculated on man it gives rise to
vesicles indistinguishable from those raised by Cowpox.
In 1863 Professor Bouley of Alfort produced pox on a
cow by inoculating it with pox from a horse, and children
were successfully vaccinated with the virus. In the
Transactions of the Clinical Society, Vol. X., Mr. John
Langton, describes the case of a groom who came to St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, 20th March, 1877, with an
eruption caught from a horse exactly like that induced
by vaccination; and there could be no question, says Mr.
Langton, that the disease was the same as that described
by Jenner as grease.</p>

<p>There is much virus in currency as vaccine that is
equine, and many of us are equinated who suppose ourselves
vaccinated; and it might be argued that we have
been saved from Smallpox by reason of our equination.
Why with all the notorious failures of vaccination, and
of re-vaccination, some of the more audacious medical
quacks do not recommend Horsepox as an infallible
alternative, is not easy to understand. It would be a
Napoleonic stroke; nor is it improbable that before vaccination
is surrendered the attempt will be made. How
easily it might be asserted that vaccination is a failure
in so far as it has lost the original virtue of equination,
that the remedy is to dismiss the cow and revert to the
horse, from whose poxy heels, as the immortal Jenner
observed, there issues “the true and genuine life-preserving
fluid.” The oracle might be worked thus&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let us hear no more of pure lymph from the calf, too
often, alas! an illusion. Sure and certain salvation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Smallpox can only be guaranteed to those inoculated
with pure pox from the horse. Come then to the horse,
the horse with pox! Come quickly! Come yourselves!
Come with your wives! Come with your children!
Come and be saved by Horsepox from the loathsome
pestilence that decimates the human race and brings
myriads to untimely graves!”</p>

<p class="noindent">It is part of the Jennerian legend that the introduction
of vaccination was resisted by prejudice, fury and fanaticism,
and that the practice made its way by sheer force
of its proven efficacy. The statement is widely at variance
with facts. Vaccination was accepted with instant
acclamation by the medical profession, the royal family,
and the public as an infallible and harmless preventive
of smallpox; and the subsequent course of experience
was to disprove alike its harmlessness and infallibility.
That in some cases vaccination was encountered with
absurdity and violence lay in the nature of things, even
as it was advocated with absurdity, violence and prevarication.
It is always easy to raise a laugh by the
exhibition of the extravagance of either side in a hot
dispute, but to what purpose? It would have been no
cause for surprise if some had been moved to scorn by
the facile credulity with which Jenner’s magical prescription
was so rashly accepted, but the world to which
he appealed had no scientific acquaintance with the laws
of health, and it was in nowise marvellous that, convinced
of the prophylaxy of inoculated smallpox, they
should have been overcome by the plausibility of inoculated
cowpox. Yet were not all overcome, nor were
all who resisted the popular craze furious. There was
John Birch, for example, surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
who with calmness and cogency steadily protested against
the introduction of “the new disease styled cowpox;”
and we may read his letters and pamphlets and fail to
note a fiery epithet or unkindly imputation. People
who talk as if all who opposed Jenner were steeped in
ignorance and perversity can know nothing of John
Birch.</p>

<p>Although satisfied with variolous inoculation, he had
no objection to vaccination in itself. He thought it fair
that experiments with cowpox should be tried, and the
verdict of experience submitted to; but he complained
that experience was anticipated and success proclaimed
ere it was possible for the truth to be known, whilst
every objector was overwhelmed with abuse. As an
illustration of the unwarrantable persuasion that prevailed
in favour of the new practice before there was time to
justify it, Birch mentions that at the anniversary dinner
at Guy’s Hospital in 1802, he was surprised to find the
usual business set aside to secure signatures to Jenner’s
petition for a vote of money from Parliament, and that
after dinner toasts, songs, and compliments in honour of
Vaccinia were the order of the day. Booksellers, he
relates, declined to publish anything against vaccination,
and editors of newspapers and magazines would not
suffer a word to appear to its disparagement. Even the
Post Office carried the cowpox and correspondence of
the Royal Jennerian Society gratis until the collapse of
the concern in 1806. Those who resorted to doctors and
hospitals for inoculation with smallpox got cowpox instead
in spite of assertions to the contrary. Church vied
with chapel in recommending the new practice. The
Archbishop of Canterbury was called upon to issue a
letter directing the clergy to recommend vaccination
from the pulpit, but, with the wariness of office, sent his
chaplain to Birch to hear the other side, and the chaplain
retired with the judicious observation, “His Grace must
not commit the Church.” Many clergymen, however,
not only preached vaccination, but practised it with
restless assiduity. Erasmus Darwin was not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
hope that baptism and vaccination might be associated.
He wrote to Jenner from Derby, 24th February,
1802&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As by the testimony of innumerable instances, the Vaccine
Disease is so favourable to young children, in a little time it may
occur that the christening and vaccination of children may always
be performed on the same day.</p></div>

<p><em>The Vaccine Disease so favourable to young children!</em>
The assertion affords a vivid glimpse of the prevalent
enchantment. “The idea of connecting religious services
with vaccination,” says Baron, “had occurred to several
individuals in this country as well as on the Continent.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I viewed with indignant scorn [wrote Birch], the ungenerous
artifice adopted by the Jennerian Society of sticking up in every
Station House, in the Vestries of fanatical Chapels, and in Sunday
Schools, that false <em>Comparative View of the effects of Smallpox
and Cowpox</em> representing to the gaping multitude a frightful picture
of Inoculation with the supposed misery attendant on it; and
exhibiting representations equally false and exaggerated of the
blessings of Vaccination.</p></div>

<p>The women were not behind the clergy in diffusing
vaccine salvation. They were Jenner’s most devoted
allies. He took pains to teach ladies to operate with “a
light hand” so as not to draw blood, and boasted that
one of his pupils had ten thousand patients to her credit,
rescued from the terror and peril of smallpox!</p>

<p>As Birch observed, it was not a question of medicine
or of surgery that he and others had to deal with, but
an outburst of enthusiasm in which the methods and
arguments of science were swept heedlessly away. Any
testimony to the credit of vaccination was accepted with
alacrity, whilst the facts to its discredit were denied or
explained away. This recklessness of procedure was
most painfully manifest in the conduct of the Committee
of the House of Commons which sat on Jenner’s first
petition for money in 1802&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The number of witnesses in support of the application [wrote
Birch] was 40, but out of the forty 28 spoke from mere hearsay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
not from knowledge acquired in practice; while the three who spoke
against it were heard impatiently, though they corroborated their
evidence with proofs.</p></div>

<p>Birch wished to know what cowpox was. Jenner had
said it was derived from horsegrease, but “that origin is
proved to be erroneous, and is now given up, even by
his best friends. On all hands it is admitted,” Birch
continued, “that it is not a disease of the cow, but communicated
to the cow by the milker. No cow that is
allowed to suckle her own calf ever has the complaint.”
What, then, is the disease in the milker? asked Birch. Is
it smallpox? Is it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lues venerea</i>? Is it itch? A man came
to St. Thomas’s Hospital from an adjacent dairy with a
hand and arm covered with ulcerations. He said several
of the milkers and the cows’ teats were affected in the
same way, and he was told they had got cowpox. Birch
called one of his country pupils and asked him what was
wrong with the man. “It is itch&mdash;rank itch,” was his
reply. A box of Jackson’s ointment for the itch was
given to him, and at the end of a week he reappeared at
the Hospital cured. If cowpox be itch, argued Birch&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then if a patient be inoculated with the disorder, though it may
suspend the capacity for Smallpox for a season in the constitution,
it will ultimately prove no security&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Which was to say, that it was not probable that smallpox
and itch could occur together, and that a person
inoculated with itch would pass through the variolous
test successfully. In this connection we may recall the
fact that Jenner found it impossible to vaccinate a regiment
at Colchester, the men with their women and
children all being afflicted with itch.</p>

<p>Still farther to complicate the mystery of cowpox,
Jenner began to describe it as genuine and spurious, but
which was the one and which was the other he left in
bewildering uncertainty. Said Birch&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though Dr. Jenner could not tell us what Cowpox was, he soon
came forward to inform us that it was of two sorts&mdash;the one genuine
and harmless, the other spurious and hurtful.</p>

<p><em>Spurious</em> Cowpox is a term I do not admit of. I know of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
such thing as <em>spurious</em> Smallpox, <em>spurious</em> Measles, <em>spurious</em> Lues
Venerea, <em>spurious</em> Scrofula.</p></div>

<p>Birch’s objection to spurious cowpox was forcible, but
what in the innocence of his heart he took for a blunder
was proved out of Jenner’s own mouth to be a deliberate
dodge in 1807. Pressed by the Committee of the College
of Physicians to explain what he meant by Spurious
Cowpox, he had to own that he knew nothing of such a
malady, and that he had only meant to describe irregular
effects of cowpox on the arms of the vaccinated! In
other words, when vaccination turned out badly, he had
found it convenient to ascribe the disaster to spurious
vaccine! The policy revealed in this shameless avowal
was cynically justified by Dr. Maunsell, who, in a well
known volume, wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The term <em>imperfect</em> or <em>Spurious</em> Vaccination is frequently to be
met with in books, and has been the cause of no small degree of
confusion in practice, although, at the same time, <em>it has frequently
afforded the practitioner an excellent asylum against the storms
now and then arising out of failures in the protective power of
the vaccine disease</em>.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p></div>

<p>From out the muddle as to the origin of cowpox and
its genuine and spurious varieties, Birch demanded,
What had Jenner discovered? It is not that cowpox
prevents smallpox; for that has been asserted by dairy-folk
for generations, and has been disregarded by
physicians because proved to be untrue. What then is
it? Let him define his discovery that we may know
how to respect it. Let him explain why it is forbidden
to inoculate direct from the cow. Is genuine cowpox
invisible and to be taken on trust? Or is the disease so
virulent on its first communication that it has to be
meliorated in the body of some victim ere it is fit for
public use? Birch asked these questions as we continue
to ask What is cowpox? Is it a disease of the cow? Or
is it communicated to the cow by man or by horse?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
However definite the answers, the contradictions are
equally definite, and the authorities equally trustworthy.</p>

<p>Practical men answered for Jenner, as they presume
to answer at this day, “Whatever may be the origin of
cowpox, we know that vaccination is harmless, and that
it prevents smallpox; and more we neither demand nor
care to inquire.” The credulity and conceit of such practical
men is that stupidity against which, says Goethe,
even the gods are powerless. It was practical men who
“on the mere show of reason” accepted vaccination
before it could be tested, and on most superficial evidence,
said Birch&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Recommended Dr. Jenner to the munificence of Parliament for
a discovery in practice which was never to prove fatal; which was
to excite no new humours or disorders in the constitution; which
was to be, not only a perfect security against Smallpox, but would,
if universally adopted, prevent its recurrence for ever.</p></div>

<p>The harmlessness of the practice was soon belied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It gave rise [wrote Birch] to new and painful disorders. It was
sometimes followed by itchy eruptions; sometimes by singular
ulcerations; and sometimes by glandular swellings of a nature
wholly distinct from scrofula, or any other known glandular
disease. Eruptions of the skin are most frequent, and may be
heard of in every parish of London; and whether Vaccination
shall be called the Cow Evil, or the Jennerian Evil, posterity will
have to determine.</p></div>

<p>The non-fatality of the practice was also speedily
confuted. The disorders it excited caused numerous
deaths&mdash;from erysipelas especially. It was then said, as
it continues to be said to this day, “Yes, but it was not
vaccination, but erysipelas the patient died of”&mdash;a form
of words that seems to satisfy many minds accounted
rational. Birch mentioned three or four cases of death
resulting from vaccination, and adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These cases were as favourably palliated and ingeniously excused
as they could be; but it is admitted <em>that each patient was
punctured by a lancet infected with what is called Cowpox; each
arm so punctured became inflamed and ulcerated, and each
patient died</em>.</p></div>

<p>The Variolous Test, used so unscrupulously to win
converts to vaccination, was proved by the Inoculators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to be untrustworthy. They had no difficulty in
variolating the vaccinated. When it was discovered
that vaccination was no guard against smallpox, many
of the vaccinated resorted to inoculation with smallpox,
and they “took” as readily as did their unvaccinated
acquaintance. Five in one family, the Hignells of
Cheltenham, vaccinated by Jenner were variolated by
Mr. Freeman, and smallpox resulted in the ordinary
course. Nothing indeed became plainer than that the
vaunted Variolous Test was a mere conjuring trick, and
the more judicious vaccinators ceased to refer to it.</p>

<p>The promise that the vaccinated would remain for ever
secure from smallpox Birch had no difficulty with. Londoners
vaccinated by the most approved operators caught
smallpox, and died precisely as did the unvaccinated.
“Every post,” said Birch in 1804, “brings me accounts of
the failures of vaccination.” As the failures multiplied, so
did the excuses. There was the prime excuse of genuine
and spurious cowpox. If vaccination failed, it could
only be through the inadvertent use of spurious vaccine.
Jenner had taught that one puncture was all-sufficient
for protection, but as one was not found effective, it was
asserted that two or three were requisite for absolute
safety. Many, it was alleged, had been imperfectly
operated upon, and the practice of the women and clergy
and other busybodies was thrown into discredit, although
at the outset their services and testimonies had been
blazoned abroad as indisputable; but Birch made this
conclusive answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It cannot be meant to class Mr. Wachsel, Apothecary to the
Smallpox Hospital, or Mr. Bing, the Accoucheur, among ignorant
and equivocal practitioners; and yet from the patients vaccinated
by these two persons I could bring instance of more failures, more
deaths, and more diseases than have occurred in the practice of
any other two persons who have come within my knowledge.</p></div>

<p>Many, moreover, who had been vaccinated by Jenner
fell victims to the disease, and he was so pestered with
awkward questions, says Birch, “that to avoid the perplexing
appeals that were made to him daily, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
messages that were perpetually sent requiring him to
visit untoward cases, he retired from London.” Subsequently
he had to forsake Cheltenham for the same
reason. The convictions of quackery were too numerous
for his endurance.</p>

<p>Having proved that vaccination did not prevent smallpox,
whilst it was a frequent cause of illness and death,
Birch held up to derision the fine promises wherewith
its advocates had beguiled the people&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Were an architect to undertake to build an edifice which
should be firm in its foundation; all its rooms wind and water
tight; and such as might be inhabited with perfect security; if,
before the edifice were well finished, the foundations were discovered
to be rotten; and if in less than seven years, several
apartments had fallen in and killed those who occupied them,
while in a great number of rooms, the wind or rain was continually
beating in, could I be blamed for declaring that the architect
had broken his contract, and that the edifice ought no longer to
be inhabited? Certainly not. Why then am I to be told that I
am acting perversely when I remonstrate against the practice of
Cowpox? for such an edifice as I have described, so rotten in its
foundations, so ill built, so ruinous, is Vaccination.</p></div>

<p>Those who take success as the test of truth may say
that Birch was unsuccessful in his contention; but he
was not unsuccessful. Vaccination in London was discredited,
and the imposture abated, as the report of the
College of Surgeons in 1807 attests. Where retained,
it was not so much as a preventive as a mitigator of
smallpox, its advocates being content to occupy the safe
position that it made milder a disease the severity of
which was unknown.</p>

<p>Birch died in 1815. His sister reprinted his papers
against vaccination (from which have come my citations<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>),
and erected a monument to his memory in St.
Margaret’s, Rood Lane, Fenchurch Street, the inscription
on which is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Jenner recognised Birch as a dangerous antagonist,
and behaved toward him with his usual meanness.
Writing from Berkeley, 11th October, 1812, to Moore
in London, where smallpox was prevalent, he observed&mdash;</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">GOLDSON AND BROWN.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">William Goldson, member of the London College of
Surgeons, practising at Portsea, published a pamphlet in
1804<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> wherein he set forth a number of instances within
his own experience of smallpox following vaccination
by infection or inoculation. He did not turn against
vaccination, but suggested that its prophylaxy might
neither be so certain nor so enduring as at first asserted.
Vaccination, he pointed out, had been carried into practice
on a wave of enthusiasm, and it was not unreasonable
to expect that on closer acquaintance some of the claims
made for it should be subject to modification. Indeed
so much was already admitted; for failures had led to
the discrimination of spurious from genuine cowpox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and to the issue of new instructions as to the period of
taking vaccine, “on which point, it was now said,
depended the whole success of the operation.” Thus
what was originally set forth as an operation for which
any novice was competent, had developed into one of
considerable delicacy with serious liability to miscarriage.
Goldson, therefore, had fair reason to believe
that his own observations and suggestions would meet
with candid consideration, and, if verified, serve for
general guidance in the practice of vaccination.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to recite Goldson’s cases. Interesting
at the time, they are now commonplace. He found
that inoculation with smallpox was possible at an
interval after vaccination, and that infection with
smallpox was equally possible under the like circumstances.
One case is noteworthy for its connection
with Jenner. A seaman, named Clarke, was successfully
vaccinated on 4th November, 1800, and, returning from
a voyage to the West Indies was put to the variolous
test on 24th March, 1802, when he sickened with smallpox
and was sent to Haslar. To prove that his malady
was really smallpox, several persons were variolated
from him. The Committee of the House of Commons
was sitting on Jenner’s first claim for public money,
and Goldson wrote to Jenner to come to Haslar and see
Clarke for himself; but Jenner was too astute to cumber
himself with difficulties at a time when so much cash
was in question. The case was mentioned to the Committee,
but was treated as of no moment in presence of
what they were pleased to regard as overwhelming
evidence as to the perpetual virtue of vaccination.</p>

<p>Goldson’s was a modest pamphlet&mdash;conjectural rather
than demonstrative. He ventured to think it was possible
that the efficacy of vaccine might be weakened by
transmission from arm to arm, and that security might
be restored by reversion to the cow&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The casual Cowpox is produced by virus immediately from the
animal; while the inoculated disease is the effect of <em>new matter</em>
generated by the action of the other on the human subject. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that <em>new matter</em> be possessed of the power to produce the same
<em>permanent</em> properties as the <em>parent</em> virus, time alone can decide.</p></div>

<p>He likewise suggested that horsegrease might be
inoculated on the nipple of the milch mare, and the
virus used for equination. These and other points were
advanced with a philosophic grace that ought to have
commanded respect; but, on the contrary, his pamphlet
was received with a howl of fury, and its author
denounced as an ill-conditioned fellow&mdash;ignorant, prejudiced,
pig-headed. It was safer to be pronounced anti-vaccinist
than a vaccinator and harbour doubt as to any
article of the Jennerian faith. Ring plied his bludgeon
over the heretic, and Jenner wrote of him with malicious
insolence&mdash;“All his reasoning is erroneous;” “his arrogance
is increased by attention;” “he obstinately holds
a veil before his eyes, and will not behold the vaccine
light;” “one might as well contend with a blind man
on the nature of a prism;” and so on. Goldson’s offence
was that he laid his finger on some of the weaker points
of vaccination; that his sight was too keen, and his
reasoning too cogent. At this day the questions between
him and Jenner are decided by vaccinators themselves in
Goldson’s favour.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most able attack on the practice of
vaccination was delivered by Thomas Brown, surgeon,
Musselburgh; and it is much to be regretted that his
book, published in Edinburgh in 1809,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> is so little known
at this day. Brown had accepted vaccination, carried
away, he admitted, by the common enthusiasm, and the unqualified
audacity with which its claims were asserted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The practice was introduced and recommended to the public by
its Author as a perfect antidote and security against Smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
without any exception or reserve, and capable of banishing Variola
from the catalogue of human misery. I have no hesitation in confessing
that I became an early convert and advocate of the new
practice; and it is now eight years and a-half since I have uniformly
advised and practised Vaccination, in which period I may
safely say, I have vaccinated upwards of twelve hundred patients,
and have only inoculated three at the positive request of parents.
This course I persevered in until the present time, notwithstanding
I met with several instances where it appeared to fail in giving
security; some about three years after the introduction of the
practice; a few more about two years ago; and those which make
part of the present volume within the last six months.</p></div>

<p>An epidemic, in which his own perfectly vaccinated
patients fell victims to smallpox, at last opened his eyes
to the delusion in which he was walking, and to the
perversity with which he and others had resisted the
light of truth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am convinced from what has passed under my own observation
for the last three or four years, that we have been <em>all</em> guilty of
rejecting evidence that deserved more attention, in consequence of
the strong prepossessions which existed, from the very persuasive
proof of Vaccination resisting inoculation and exposure to infection,
and from our judgments being goaded and overpowered with
the <em>positive</em> and <em>arbitrary</em> opinions of its abettors. I am now
perfectly satisfied, from my mind being under the influence of
prejudice and blind to the impression of the fairest evidence, that
the last time Smallpox was prevalent, I rejected and explained
away many cases which were entitled to the most serious attention,
and showed myself as <em>violent</em> and <em>unreasonable</em> a partisan as any
of my brethren in propagating a practice, which I have now little
doubt we must ere long surrender at discretion.</p></div>

<p>When Brown first saw the vaccinated prostrate with
smallpox, he concluded that there must have been some
mistake about their vaccination; “for after Vaccination
it was impossible to contract Smallpox;” but the evidence
of his senses gradually overcame the phantasy
imposed upon him, and like an honest man he proclaimed
his error, and verified the experiences whereby he
had been reluctantly corrected. He set forth with all
particulars forty-eight cases of smallpox following vaccination
within his own immediate cognizance, and
though aware of many cases outside that cognizance,
he limited himself to what he could attest with personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
assurance. He knew he would be told that the vaccinations
had been imperfect, or that what he took for
smallpox was some other eruption&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is strenuously contended [said Brown] by nearly every author,
and by almost every practitioner, that Vaccination is a perfect
antidote against Smallpox, if the disease be properly communicated;
and Dr. Jenner and his relative, Mr. G. Jenner, positively assert,
that they have had not one instance of failure in their own practice.
They all therefore, and without hesitation, refer the whole series
of failures that have been brought forward to the sweeping power
of imperfect Vaccination, or to the blindness and stupidity of the
medical practitioner who cannot distinguish between Smallpox and
Chickenpox, a rash, or bug-bites.</p></div>

<p>Nor did Brown rest satisfied with proving that vaccination
did not prevent smallpox. He also showed the
fallacy of the variolous test. He adduced twelve cases
in which vaccinated persons had been variolated as if
they had never been vaccinated. Also four cases in
which vaccination and variolation were effected simultaneously,
the diseases running their courses concurrently,
proving there was no antagonism between them; and
since they could occur together, what reason was left for
supposing that one might not succeed the other?</p>

<p>Having found liberty in the truth, he reverted to
Jenner’s writings, and reading them with opened eyes,
he was not slow to detect and to demonstrate the laxity
of statement, the contradictions, and absurdities with
which they were pervaded. No reply was attempted:
no reply, indeed, was possible. The surgeons of the
Edinburgh Vaccine Institution issued <cite>An Examination
of Mr. Brown’s Opinions and Statements</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but they
merely carped over non-essential details, and left the
main issues wholly unaffected. What they had to show
was that Brown’s patients were either unvaccinated, or
had not had smallpox; and unable to do this, they were
unable to do anything.</p>

<p>Brown remained victor. He did not overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
vaccination, nor restore variolation, but he did make an
end in Scotland of confidence in vaccination as an omnipotent
safeguard against smallpox. The rite continued to
be practised on humbler terms: “it did no harm”: even
Mr. Brown allowed that it might keep off smallpox for a
time: and “there was reason to believe that it tended to
make the disease milder when it did occur.” Thirty
years after his first publication, in 1842, Brown reaffirmed
his position in a series of letters<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> to Dr. George Gregory,
a sympathetic friend, and advised a return to variolation
in view of “the acknowledged defects of the Jennerian
practice”&mdash;a dismal alternative. But it is in vain to
expect any man to be <em>much</em> in advance of his time: it
suffices for honourable distinction that he <em>be</em> in advance.
When Brown commenced practice, smallpox and other
fevers were regarded as inevitable as storms and earthquakes,
and the knowledge with which we are now so
familiar, that they are engendered in foul habits and
habitations, was for practical purposes unknown. Our
reproach is, that knowing so much better, we surrender
ourselves to a superstitious observance conceived in days
of darkness.</p>

<p class="noindent">It may be well to devote a chapter to those antagonists
of Vaccination who, though right in their contention
against cowpox, did more or less to discredit their cause
by scurrility and extravagance. The faults of these men
are frequently adduced as evidence of the absurd and
brutal resistance with which Vaccination was encountered,
but it is forgotten how intense was their provocation,
and how the bad on one side was matched by the bad on
the other. It was a contest between Smallpoxers and
Cowpoxers, alike ignorant of the conditions of physical
well-being. It is plain, however, in the light of our later
experience, that much that was asserted by the Smallpoxers
of the uselessness and harmfulness of cowpox
must have been exactly and painfully true, though persistently
and ferociously denied.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for October, 1806, appeared
an article entitled “Pamphlets on Vaccine Inoculation,”
which may be taken as a reflection of the state of the
controversy at that date, and as an index to the chief
offenders against propriety. The article was written by
the editor, Francis Jeffrey, and was a product of that perspicuous
intelligence, which reduced to order whatever
was subjected to its action, in much the same way that a
housemaid “sets to rights” a library by ranging the
books according to their sizes and bindings, and assorting
the papers so that they lie neatly disposed. As is the
habit of able editors, a view of the variolous controversy
was evolved that might be comfortably accepted and confidently
repeated by his readers&mdash;the evolution of such
rational mirage being regarded for the time as veracious
matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>First we may take the reviewer’s evidence as to the
extent and fury of the controversy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ample and public testimony offered in favour of Vaccination
seemed for a while to set the question at rest; and, except in a few
obscure pamphlets and communications to the medical journals,
little was heard in opposition to it, till 1804, when Mr. Goldson of
Portsmouth published six cases of Smallpox occurring after Vaccination,
accompanied with observations, calculated to shake the
confidence which was now very generally placed in the security of
the Jennerian inoculation. These were answered by Mr. Ring and
others, who endeavoured to show that, in some of his cases, Mr.
Goldson’s patients had not had the genuine Cowpox in the first
instance, and that in others, they had not had the genuine Smallpox
thereafter. This part of the controversy was conducted with
temper, and with a reasonable degree of candour. In the end of
the same year however, Dr. Moseley published his treatise on the
Cowpox, in which the ravings of Bedlam seemed to be blended
with the tropes of Billingsgate. Dr. Rowley followed on the same
side, and in the same temper, with 500 cases of “the beastly new
diseases produced from Cowpox,” and attracted customers by two
coloured engravings at the head of his work of “the Cowpoxed, ox-faced
boy,” and the “Cowpoxed, mangey girl.” The battle now became
general. The Reverend Rowland Hill thundered in defence of
vaccination&mdash;Dr. Squirrel leaped from his cage upon the whole
herd of vaccinators&mdash;Mr. Birch insisted upon stating his serious
reasons for objecting to Cowpox&mdash;Drs. Thornton and Lettsom
chanted pæans in its praise&mdash;Mr. Lipscomb strutted forward with
a ponderous, wordy dissertation on its failures and mischiefs; and
Messrs. Ring, Merriman, and Blair answered everybody; and exasperated
all their opponents by their intemperance and personality.
Charges of murder and falsehood were interchanged among the
disputants without the smallest ceremony; the medical journals
foamed with the violence of their contention; it raged in hospitals
and sick-chambers; and polluted with its malignity the sanctity of
the pulpit and the harmony of convivial philanthropy.</p>

<p>In the whole course of our censorial labours, we have never had
occasion to contemplate a scene so disgusting and humiliating as is
presented by the greater part of this controversy; nor do we believe
that the virulence of political animosity or personal rivalry or
revenge ever gave rise, among the lowest and most prostituted
scribblers, to so much coarseness, illiberality, violence and absurdity
as is here exhibited by gentlemen of sense and education discussing
a point of professional science with a view to the good of mankind.
At one time, indeed, we were so overpowered and confounded by
the clamour and vehement contradictions of the combatants, that
we were tempted to abandon the task we had undertaken, and
leave it to some more athletic critic to collect the few facts and the
little reasoning which could be discerned in this tempest of the
medical world.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Furious was the controversy, but why was it furious?
There are often great fights over little matters, but the
reason is that the little matters are vitally related to the
self-love of the combatants; and thus it was with the
Cowpoxers and the Smallpoxers. The Cowpoxers set
out with the absolute assertion that whoever submitted
to their prescription would be secure from smallpox for
life. Without proof, or with powerful sham proof, the
assertion was endorsed by the mass of the medical profession,
and there followed the conversion of the community
in that sort of faith-panic which is described by
Carlyle as Swarmery&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the world assenting, and continually repeating and reverberating,
there soon comes that singular phenomenon called
Swarmery, or the gathering of men in swarms; and what prodigies
they are in the habit of doing and believing when thrown into that
miraculous condition! Singular, in the case of human swarms,
with what perfection of unanimity and quasi-religious conviction
the stupidest absurdities can be received as axioms of Euclid, nay,
as articles of faith, which you are not only to believe, unless
malignantly insane, but are (if you have any honour or morality)
to push into practice, and, without delay see <em>done</em>, if your soul
would live.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p></div>

<p>People thus enchanted do not like to be brought to
their senses; and medical men, who in 1800 attested the
perpetual prophylaxy of cowpox, were naturally very
unwilling to be proved deceivers and deceived. When
cases of smallpox were reported as following vaccination,
they at first denied the possibility, saying that either
there had been no vaccination, or that the smallpox was
not smallpox. On the other hand, the Smallpoxers who
had been snuffed out by the Cowpoxers, revived in
presence of the discovered impotence of the new practice,
and stoutly maintained, and cruelly demonstrated that
unquestionable vaccinations were followed by unquestionable
smallpox. It needs little acquaintance with
human nature to see unlimited elements of bitterness in
these conditions. To be convicted of imposture does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
beget equanimity, nor contradiction as to plain matter-of-fact;
and thus convicted were the Cowpoxers and
thus contradicted were the Smallpoxers.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh reviewer described Dr. Moseley’s treatise
on cowpox as blending “the ravings of Bedlam with the
tropes of Billingsgate.” Some Billingsgate I concede, but
not Bedlam at all. Much however depends on the point
of view. Vaccination if regarded as a blessing in which
the inspiration of heaven was consummated in the salvation
of the human race from smallpox,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> resistance thereto
might appear, as Carlyle observes of creatures under
enchantment, as “malignantly insane.”</p>

<p>Dr. Moseley’s book,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> it is to be allowed, was singularly
exasperating. He had spoken against cowpox from the
outset, and was charged with condemning that of which
he knew nothing; to which he cogently replied that he
could scarcely know less than the gang of medical men who
attested its perpetual efficacy in the newspapers in 1800
before they had any proper experience of it whatever. If
his scepticism was premature, what was their credulity?
Moseley had patience: no argument could be heard in
the rage that set in for the new salvation. “Cowpox, I
admit, is not contagious,” he said, “but cow-mania is.”
When, however, in process of time it was seen in hundreds
of cases that cowpox conferred no immunity from smallpox,
he published in 1804 <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lues Bovilla</cite>&mdash;a somewhat
pompous treatise, with frequent touches of superfluous
learning, and permeated with the irritating superiority
of the true prophet&mdash;“You see it has turned out just as
I predicted.” Nor was he content to make general assertions:
he specified the names and addresses of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
had been correctly vaccinated, or had taken cowpox from
the cow, and had subsequently suffered from smallpox
with their neighbours; also of cases of severe illness,
injury, and death resulting from vaccination. Bluster
was idle in presence of such facts. Even the Royal
Jennerians had to eat humble pie, for in their Report,
dated 2nd January, 1806, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is admitted by the Committee that a few cases have been
brought before them of persons having the Smallpox who had
apparently passed through the Cowpox in a regular way.</p></div>

<p>With so much admitted by such furious fanatics, what
might not be inferred!</p>

<p>Moseley was held in high esteem alike by the profession
and the public, and his judgment enforced by so much
serious evidence contributed heavily to the discredit of
vaccination, and unfortunately to the resumption of
variolous inoculation. That the reaction was extensive,
especially in London, appears from numerous contemporary
testimonies, which Moseley confirms in saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people at large are not to be reproached for putting their
faith in this splendid imposition on humanity; and to the credit
of their discernment and parental feelings, the middle and inferior
classes have taken precedence in renouncing the delusion. At
this moment, unless attacked by surprise, or with threats, or
cajoled by artifice (all of which have been practised on them) there
are now none among them in London and the adjacent villages
who will expose their children to Cowpox Inoculation.</p></div>

<p>Rowland Hill was a religious and philanthropic notable
in those days, and in common with many of his kind,
was an enthusiastic vaccinator. A leading spirit in the
Royal Jennerian Society, he had the school-room of
Surrey Chapel constituted a vaccination station whereat
Dr. Walker officiated. Nor was he content to patronise
the practice, but was himself an energetic operator.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Jennerian Society,
17th May, 1806, he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With my own hands I have vaccinated upwards of 5000
persons,” and, lifting up his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, “I
solemnly declare before God, I have not had a failure in a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
instance. What then shall we say of the false and daring publications
of those who denounce the benign practice, and how shall
they answer for their conduct to their King, their Country, and
their God!”</p></div>

<p>Hill and Jenner were great friends. Hill visited
Jenner at Berkeley, and Jenner heard Hill when he
preached at Cheltenham. Introducing Jenner to a nobleman,
Hill remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>“Allow me to present to your Lordship my friend Dr.
Jenner, who has been the means of saving more lives
than any other man.”</p>

<p>To which Jenner, being of a pious turn, sighed with
meek effusion&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah! would I, like you, could say <em>souls</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>So committed and so possessed, Hill naturally resented
the growing distrust of vaccination. It cut him deeply to
be supposed a quack; and in 1806 he issued a pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
relating his experiences as a Jennerite, defending his
practice, and denouncing those who treated it despitefully.
Moseley especially was subjected to severe and
contemptuous condemnation. Hill’s sanctimony and
virulence, his vigour and venom compose a piquant
mixture, and if we could tarry for amusement we might
produce it abundantly from a variety of elegant extracts.
Consider, for instance, this his adjuration, and its pitiful
object&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh, the blessing of the Jennerian inoculation! Did ever man
stand as Jenner so much like an Angel of God, an instrument in
the hands of Divine Providence between the living and the dead
till the plague was stayed!</p></div>

<p>Hill’s latent assumption throughout his discourse was&mdash;</p>

<p>First, that all must have smallpox; and</p>

<p>Second, that all the vaccinated who escaped smallpox,
owed their salvation to their Jennerisation.</p>

<p>It never apparently occurred to him that before Jenner
was heard of, many passed through life exempt from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
smallpox; nor, consequently, did he inquire <em>how</em> they
escaped; nor <em>why</em>, when vaccination was introduced,
escape should be placed to its credit.</p>

<p>The belief in the vicarious influence of vaccination
comes out strongly, too, in Hill’s pamphlet. Of Londoners
there were then over 1,000,000, and of these, he
says, at least, 100,000 had been vaccinated, and with this
effect&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vaccination reduced the deaths from Smallpox in London to 10
per week; but after the Inoculators had been making their
clamours, the applicants for Vaccination diminished, and the
deaths soon rose to 100 per week.</p>

<p>Now can effrontery itself deny that the introduction of Vaccination
was the sole cause of reducing the fatality on the Smallpox list?</p></div>

<p>Thus one in ten being vaccinated, smallpox was reduced
throughout the unvaccinated 9-10ths; and as soon
as the vicarious operations dropped, up went the rate of
mortality! Nor was Hill singular in this persuasion.
He cited his friend Dr. Lettsom as writing to him, 25th
March, 1806&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vaccination was gradually lessening the mortality in 1804, when
about the middle of 1805 false reports against Vaccination gained
very general credit, and Vaccination was nearly suspended; the
consequence was the death of 1286 children in four months
(September to December) or ten every day, each of whom might
now have been alive had the blessing of Vaccination been accepted.</p></div>

<p>And again I find Lettsom wrote to Moseley, November,
1808&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The increase of births and decrease of deaths has added 3000
lives annually to the population of London during the period that
Vaccination has been practised.</p></div>

<p>Talk evidently sincere, and widely repeated, but with
how little consideration for truth!</p>

<p>To return to Moseley. He was not the man to endure
Hill’s aggression submissively, and in a pamphlet entitled
<cite>An Oliver for a Rowland</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> he made a terrific reprisal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
The public were delighted with it, and in the course of
a few months it ran through ten editions. Hill was
generally regarded as a clerical mountebank, with more
impudence than piety, and to see him knocked over,
kicked, and rolled in the mire, was sport that carried
many sympathisers. Moseley’s opening address gives
the key to the whole performance&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rowland</span>,&mdash;I bought your pamphlet, entitled <cite>Cowpox Inoculation
Vindicated</cite>, dated the 25th of March, 1806.</p>

<p>I paid a shilling for it. Rowland,&mdash;it is not dear. The same
quantity of folly, falsehood, and impudence, could not have been
bought for twice the money of any other Cowpoxer from the Ganges
to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>But let me ask you, Rowland, what could induce you to take up
your pen to attack me on the subject of Physic, who never attacked
you on the subject of Religion? Would it not have been more
prudent in you to have continued to expose yourself in your own
trade in your own shop?</p>

<p>As to my learned friend Dr. Lettsom (who is never out of the way
when there is good to be done) being moved to instigate you, a
Methodist parson, to enter into a medical controversy&mdash;that can
only be accounted for by supposing he owes you a grudge, and put
you into my hands for payment.</p></div>

<p>Paid he was with interest&mdash;gross and Rabelaisian; and
Hill, when he had picked himself up and recovered his
senses, discreetly retired from the combat.</p>

<p>Spite of his pomposity and buffoonery, there was good
sense and humour in Moseley, and his resistance to the
Jennerian mania was not ineffective. As he wrote in
1808&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is ten years since I began this Trojan war against Vaccinia;
and if it be not yet ended, I have at least the satisfaction to see that
her original troops are no longer able to defend her throne; and
that the mobled Queen with “a clout upon her head where late
diadem stood,” has fallen to a new dynasty of mercenaries.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p></div>

<p>In Dr. Munk’s <cite>Roll of the Royal College of Physicians</cite>
we read, that Dr. Moseley was appointed physician to
Chelsea Hospital in 1788, “an office which he filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the highest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> for more than thirty years”&mdash;until his
death in 1819&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though a shrewd practitioner, and undeniably a man of extensive
mental capacity and very considerable attainments, Dr.
Moseley was a violent opponent of Vaccination, on which his communications
to the press were incessant. They did little credit to
his medical penetration, or his qualifications as a dispassionate
searcher after truth, and, happily for his reputation, are now well
nigh forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p></div>

<p>Are they? For what else is Dr. Moseley remembered?
So that a man does his duty in the world, whether he
be forgotten or remembered is not worth a thought; but
Moseley’s early and steadfast resistance to the Cowpox
Imposture will long constitute his title to grateful recollection.</p>

<p>Dr. William Rowley, Physician to the Marylebone
Infirmary, also left his mark in medical history as a
determined opponent of vaccination. He had seen the
profession and the public go mad about so many absurd
novelties, that it did not surprise him that they should
go mad about cowpox: and after due experience and
investigation he delivered judgment on the craze and its
pernicious effects in a pamphlet entitled <cite>Cowpox Inoculation
no Security against Smallpox</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> containing two
coloured engravings representing the Cowpoxed Ox-Faced
Boy, and the Cowpoxed Mangey Girl. Much
ridicule was expended on these pictures, and to this day
whoever wishes to be funny and create giggle over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
early resistance to vaccination tells how one Dr. Rowley
maintained that Jenner’s benign virus induced the face
of an ox on a boy; but like the majority of comic
anecdotes, it is untrue. The engraving represents a
comely lad with a swelling on the upper part of his left
cheek, which was thought to give that side of his face
an ox-like expression. Many a medical practitioner
among the poor would at this day have little difficulty
in presenting living examples of affliction answering to
Rowley’s pictures&mdash;and worse. It was, moreover, the
fear or fancy of many at the time that inoculation with
cowpox might beget bovine characteristics in the human
species, and the fear or fancy was turned to inevitable
account in jest and earnest. The jest is visible in some
of Rowlandson’s caricatures, and stories like this got into
circulation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A child at Peckham, after being inoculated with Cowpox, had its
former natural disposition absolutely changed to the brutal, so that
it ran upon all fours like a <em>beast</em>, bellowing like a <em>cow</em>, and butting
like a <em>bull</em>.</p></div>

<p>In order to discredit Rowley, it is thought fair policy
to connect him with such nonsense, and to have it supposed
that he rested his case upon “the cowpoxed ox-faced
boy:” it was far otherwise. He diligently tracked
the vaccinators, and accumulated 504 cases of smallpox
and injury after vaccination with 75 deaths, particulars
being accurately specified. Nor was he content merely
to report what he had ascertained. “Come and see,” was
his forcible argument. “I have lately had under my
care,” he wrote, “some of the worst species of malignant
smallpox in the Marylebone Infirmary, which many of
the faculty have examined and know to have been vaccinated.”
His trust in “Come and see,” he still more
powerfully exemplified in an exhibition of the injuries
inflicted by vaccination in his Lecture Room in Savile
Row in October, 1805. “Knowing,” he said, “the caviling
character of the Cowpoxers, I determined to leave
them no hole for retreat”; and therefore he brought
together Joules, “the ox-faced boy, who also had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
terribly diseased elbow-joint”; Marianne Lewis, the
mangey girl, “who was covered with blotches like a
leopard”; “a load of children in a cart from the south
of London,” and others accompanied by their parents,
and displaying their various maladies, said, “Behold the
effects of the new disease that has been taken from the
cow and implanted in humanity!” This painful exposition
was continued over two days, and as he records,
“the scene was truly affecting and distressing to all who
witnessed it.” An antagonist like Rowley is a serious
factor in any controversy, and we may estimate the havoc
he wrought by the extreme anxiety of the Jennerites to
have him estimated by the supposed absurdity of the
ox-faced boy.</p>

<p>To a man of practical temper like Rowley, the enthusiasm
with which vaccination was at first advocated
appeared akin to delirium&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been in some vaccination storms, and have had the buttons
torn off my coat, cloth and all, to convince me of the great and
infallible excellence of Cowpox. I have seen some of the vehement
vaccinators redden like a flame with fury, their lips quivering, their
eyes starting out of their heads, their mouths foaming, their tongues
dropping hard words, and their fists clenched like pugilists, ready
to accompany their violent wrath with other knock-down arguments.
In such circumstances, mild, investigating Philosophy
quits the scene and leaves the field of battle to the Bedlamites.</p></div>

<p>The fury had subsided in 1805, and Rowley held that
many medical men were deeply ashamed of the extravagance
into which they had been committed, but lacked
courage to make frank confession.</p>

<p>Rowley died in 1806, and the regard in which he was
held was manifest in the crowds who flocked to his
funeral. In the <cite>Roll of Physicians</cite>, Dr. Munk observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Rowley was a determined opponent of Vaccination, and
obtained an unenviable notoriety by his association with Dr.
Moseley in opposing every conceivable obstacle to the reception and
progress of that invaluable discovery.</p></div>

<p>The obstacles interposed were matters-of-fact, and as
matters-of-fact were recognised and prevailed.</p>

<p>The controversy that followed the introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Vaccination “gave birth,” says the Edinburgh reviewer,
“to an infinite number of publications of all descriptions”
from which he could only select the most characteristic.
Among these we find Dr. Squirrel, whose book is
described “as the most entertaining of the whole”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We will venture to say, though we know it to be a bold assertion,
that there never was anything so ill-written, or so vulgar and
absurd, produced before by a person entitling himself a Doctor of
Medicine. There is a certain nimbleness and agility about him,
however, which keeps us in good humour, and he whisks about
with such a self-satisfied springiness and activity, that it is really
enlivening to look on him.</p></div>

<p>Turning up Squirrel’s pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> I find little or nothing
to warrant this description. It is not ill-written, if
judged by the standard of medical literature, and the
“springiness” is a conceit of the reviewer’s to sport with
the Doctor’s name. My own impression is that Squirrel
was a dull fellow, jealous of cowpox as injurious to the
trade in smallpox inoculation, and that he availed himself
of the depression in the vaccination business to assert
its superiority. He admits, indeed, that he kept silent
during the Jennerian furore, “but the overwhelming
torrent being gradually reduced to a feeble current,” he
reckoned that he “might now promulgate his opinion
with a reasonable hope of success.” He cites Jenner’s
account of the origin of cowpox in the greasy heels of
horses, and proceeds to argue that the disease is scrofula,
which its inoculation is certain to diffuse, whilst affording
no protection from smallpox. He then adduces a number
of cases in proof that inoculated cowpox had not averted
smallpox, and had in several instances brought on serious
and fatal ailments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Jenner in a letter to Moore from Berkeley, 28th
February, 1810, thus refers to Squirrel&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Gale Jones, I see, has at length succeeded in obtaining the
situation for which he has long been a candidate. This fellow had
once the impudence to desire a man to call on me in Bedford Place
to say, that he, Jones, would advise me immediately to quit
London, for there was no knowing what an enraged populace
might do. He was the writer of Squirrel’s book, the long anti-vaccine
columns in the <cite>Independent Whig</cite>, and many of the most
violent papers in the <cite>Medical Observer</cite>. I was held up in his
Forum for several nights as an object of derision; but I silenced
him by the same weapon as I have others&mdash;contempt.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner’s contempt was of a miraculous quality, operating
insensibly upon those to whom it was applied.
Some might fancy it was his idleness and others his
cowardice; but he knew that it was <em>his contempt</em>, and
that it blasted his adversaries in much the same way
that vaccination blasted smallpox.</p>

<p>There is the woeful monotony of truth in these old
pamphlets, not merely in the occurrence of smallpox
after vaccination, but in the sadder stories of acute and
chronic blood-poisoning. We recognise the narratives
as true, for they are reproduced among us continuously
by the same means, with the same miseries and agonies,
and with the same death for grateful release.</p>

<p>It is clear from the testimony of Moseley, Rowley and
Squirrel, confirmed too by others and by the Jennerites
themselves, that the extension of vaccination met with a
decided check in London. It was proved to many in a
fashion that did not admit of dispute, that vaccination
conferred no security from smallpox, whilst it was
attended with dangers to health, certain if as yet
undefinable. Variolous inoculation was again reverted
to, but by diminished numbers; for that practice never
had prevailed with popular good-will, but through sedulous
medical persuasion as duty of dire necessity.
Vaccination afforded excuse for hesitation, and, between
rival claims, many contrived to elude either form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
pollution. Thus indirectly as it were, vaccine inoculation
set aside variolous, and when in 1840 the latter was
forbidden by law, there was little of the practice left,
whilst at the same time the majority of the population
existed without Jennerian protection.</p>

<p>It is not to be forgotten that the early resistance to
vaccination proceeded entirely from inoculators with
smallpox. It was as yet unimagined that smallpox and
other fevers were preventible, that their causes lay
within control, and that health was the best defence of
health. The world as yet lay in darkness as to those
truths which we now recognise as laws of health, hygiene,
and sanitary science; nor has the darkness rolled away,
but is rolling away, and the time is not distant when to
be vaccinated in order to be safe from smallpox will be
accounted the drollest of absurdities.</p>

<p>Going back to the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, we remark
with curious interest how the chief position then asserted
was the abiding efficacy of vaccination. Inoculators
were ready to concede that it might possess a temporary
prophylaxy, inasmuch as until one blood fever had
subsided another was unlikely to supervene; but this
view Jeffrey declined to entertain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It seems contrary to all analogy, and all rules of reasoning to
suppose, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, that an immunity which is found to subsist for a
certain time in the usual and healthful state of the system, will
gradually and insensibly wear away without any apparent cause,
or any sensible change to indicate its extinction; and the facts
which bear at all upon the question, so far from suggesting or
supporting such a supposition, seem, in our apprehension, completely
to refute and discredit it.</p></div>

<p>Yet what in 1806 was accounted “contrary to all
analogy,” and “completely refuted and discredited by
facts,” is precisely what vaccinators now admit. Hence
their cry for re-vaccination&mdash;septennially, triennially,
annually. Dr. Lionel Beale, a great authority in the
matter, recently owned to having been vaccinated ten
times, and in terror of an epidemic was about to be
vaccinated once more&mdash;a striking exemplification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
contemporary theory and practice. To have foreseen
such an issue would have confounded the early vaccinators.
When re-vaccination was mentioned to Dr. Pearson,
he denied its possibility; “for,” said he, “Vaccination is
equivalent to smallpox, which cannot recur. If a child
can be re-vaccinated, then it can take smallpox; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>
vaccination is not an equivalent for smallpox; and where
then is the good of it?” Where indeed!</p>

<p>The Edinburgh reviewer was sufficiently impartial to
recognise violence alike among Cowpoxers and Smallpoxers,
and specified John Ping, Jenner’s bully, as an
offender, describing his <cite>Treatise on Cowpox</cite> as “one
thousand and forty chaotic pages in defence of the new
practice.” Ring verified the criticism by issuing a
pamphlet, <cite>The Beauties of the Edinburgh Review</cite> alias
<em>the Stink-Pot of Literature</em>; reminding us of the man
who writing to his wife from an inn-parlour remarked,
“I must conclude, for an unmannerly Irishman is looking
over my shoulder and reading every word I write;” an
observation that was immediately clenched with, “You
are a liar, sir; a liar!”</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">WILLIAM COBBETT.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Everybody appeals to common-sense, but what is common-sense?
It is a question difficult to answer; and
yet, as I propose to show that Cobbett’s opposition to
vaccination was justified by common-sense, I am bound
to give some definition of the term.</p>

<p>Common-sense is reason as evolved from common
experience. What the multitude of men have found to
be true in the course of life, that is common-sense, which
to question or resist is folly or fanaticism. This vulgar
and vigorous rationality is often summoned to service
where it has no vocation. For example, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was first taught that the earth was a sphere and that
its inhabitants had antipodes, the revelation was denounced
as contrary to common-sense; but it is
obvious that in such a case (which represents myriads)
it was wrongly invoked; the form of the earth being at
the time outside common cognisance. As soon, however,
as it was realised by experience that the earth was
spherical and inhabited in all its quarters, then its
rotundity became incorporated in the constitution of
common-sense.</p>

<p>The realm of common-sense I therefore hold to be
limited by its origin in common experience, and in
matters above or beyond that experience, its dicta are
illegitimate, and synonyms for presumption and prejudice.</p>

<p>William Cobbett was essentially a man of common-sense.
His power lay in his community with the experience
and reason of his countrymen; and, like all of us,
he had the defects of his virtue. He continually applied
his vulgar judgment to the criticism of men and matters
beyond the range of his competence, and the result was
a luxuriance of arrogance and contempt for which at
this day we must resort to Mr. Ruskin for a parallel.</p>

<p>Such being the case, we have to inquire, What was the
worth of Cobbett’s opinion in the matter of vaccination?
The attempt is sometimes made by vaccinators to withdraw
their practice from popular discussion. They say
it is a medical question for medical men; but the assertion
provokes suspicion rather than confidence, for
mystery is an invariable note of imposture. It is fair, I
allow, to say of any abstruse knowledge that it can only
be apprehended by those whose faculties are trained for
its apprehension; but what is there abstruse about
vaccination? With little trouble, everybody may know
as much about it as anybody. It is the simplest of surgical
operations. It is almost as easy as taking pills&mdash;instead
of putting poison down the throat it is inserted
into the skin. The operation may result in any number
of pathological complications, but whether such complications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
be admitted or denied, what vaccination is prescribed
for, namely, the prevention of smallpox, comes
within the range of common observation. What, therefore,
I have to answer is, that Cobbett’s common-sense
was competent to deliver judgment upon vaccination.</p>

<p>Moreover, the circumstances of the time compelled an
opinion: silence or neutrality was impossible. England
was swarming with vaccinators. All the fussy folk
who had a taste for doing much good at little cost were
plying the cowpox lancet. Encouraged by Jenner, they
got vaccine, inoculated a victim, and propagated the
virus from arm to arm. Here I may let Cobbett speak
for himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This nation is fond of quackery of all sorts; and this particular
quackery having been sanctioned by King, Lords, and Commons,
it spread over the country like a pestilence borne by the winds.
Speedily sprang up the Royal Jennerian Institution, and branch
institutions issuing from the parent trunk, set instantly to work,
impregnating the veins of the rising generation with the beastly
matter. Gentlemen and ladies made the commodity a pocket
companion; and if a cottager’s child was seen by them on a
common (in Hampshire at least) and did not quickly take to its
heels, it was certain to carry off more or less of the disease of the
cow. One would have thought that half the cows in the country
had been tapped to get such a quantity of stuff.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p></div>

<p>Nor was vaccination merely forced on Cobbett’s attention
as a popular craze. He had to deal with it as a
possible compulsory infliction. At a public meeting in
1803, Wilberforce and Dr. Clarke advocated the prohibition
of smallpox inoculation and the enforcement of
vaccination; and Cobbett, in a letter addressed to Wilberforce,
rebuked the arbitrary project in a strain impressive
and dignified as that of Burke himself. He
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It seems there are prejudices against cowpox which it is necessary
to destroy by force. That there are prejudices, and very
strong ones too, I am ready to allow, but I cannot agree that these
prejudices should be eradicated by force; nor is it perhaps fair to
use the degrading term as expressive of the dislike which so large
a portion of the community entertain to the practice you are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
anxious to compel them to adopt. The charge of prejudice has
been preferred but too often, and with but too fatal success against
every one opposed to change. The truth is that whoever has been
found to object to innovation, however wild in itself, however
destructive in its consequences, has constantly been accused of
prejudice; and as prejudice thus used implies a mixture of <em>ignorance</em>
and <em>perverseness</em>, and as few persons are willing to be thought
ignorant and perverse, the imputation is employed to coerce assent
where reason hesitates.</p></div>

<p>He then aptly applied the repudiated recommendation
of inoculation with smallpox as cause for hesitation in
assenting to inoculation with cowpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was, you must well remember, a strong and general objection,
which for a long time prevailed, against Inoculation with
Smallpox; and you cannot have forgotten that this objection was
termed <em>prejudice</em>, and the persons entertaining it were regarded as
<em>illiterate</em>, <em>ignorant</em>, or <em>perverse</em>; yet it now appears from the
Address of your Royal Jennerian Society that it would have been
well for the human race if the prejudices of those illiterate, ignorant,
or perverse persons had universally obtained; for you now
tell us that “Inoculation by spreading the contagion has considerably
increased the mortality of Smallpox.” With an example
like this before our eyes, Ought we not to be very cautious how we
adopt your new system of Inoculation with Cowpox?</p></div>

<p>Then turning upon Wilberforce in his favourite character
of constitutional Englishman, he proceeded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Give me leave to ask you, Sir, how you reconcile a proposition
to enforce this novel practice with the spirit of that Constitution
of which you profess to be so great an admirer, and with that
freedom of which you wish to be regarded as one of the principal
supporters? What I am opposed to, and what I am alarmed at,
is the proposition to obtain an Act of Parliament which would in
its operation be nothing short of compulsion on every man to suffer
the veins of his child to be impregnated with the disease of a beast&mdash;a
measure to be adopted in no country where the people are not
vassals or slaves.</p></div>

<p>Lastly came these remarks which at this day have
force and application greater even than when written&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I like not this never-ending recurrence to Acts of Parliament.
Something must be left, and something <em>ought</em> to be left, to the
sense and reason and morality and religion of the people. There
are a set of <em>well-meaning men</em> in this country, who would pass
laws for the regulating and restraining of every feeling of the
human breast, and every motion of the human frame: they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
bind us down, hair by hair, as the Liliputians did Gulliver, till
anon, when we awoke from our sleep, we should wonder by whom
we had been enslaved. But I trust, Sir, that Parliament is not,
and never will be, so far under the influence of these minute and
meddling politicians as to be induced to pass laws for taking out of
a man’s hands the management of his household, the choice of his
physician, and the care of the health of his children; for, under
this sort of domiciliary thraldom, to talk of the liberty of the country
would be the most cruel mockery wherewith an humble and
subjected people were ever insulted.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p></div>

<p>Cobbett, be it observed, thus addressed Wilberforce in
1803, when vaccination was as yet imperfectly tested,
and its advocates were in the full blast of enthusiastic
persuasion that to be Jennerised was to be made proof
against smallpox for ever. When Cobbett had again
occasion to write about cowpox, six years had passed
away, bearing with them the phantastic certainty with
which vaccination had been imposed upon public credulity.
Nevertheless the practice was not abandoned:
quackery once alive and lucrative, dies hard: but it was
discredited, and its apologists exercised their ingenuity
in devising explanations and excuses for its manifest
failures. The Royal Jennerian Society had split between
Jenner and Walker, and application to Parliament was
resolved upon for two purposes&mdash;first, to save Jenner
from poverty; and second, to provide funds for the
maintenance of vaccination, voluntary subscriptions having
fallen off irretrievably. In short, vaccination had
broken down, and the House of Commons was called
upon to save it from extinction. There were wire-pullers
in the House and out of the House who were compromised
by their patronage of Jenner and his imposture,
and they had the craft and the power to transfer the
responsibility of which they were sick to the national
exchequer. With this explanation, we shall understand
the following article from the <cite>Register</cite> of 18th June,
1808. Cobbett wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This experiment with Cowpox, which has cost the nation £30,000
to Dr. Jenner, is now, it seems, to have an Act of Parliament to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
give it currency. Mr. Rose has brought in a bill for the purpose
of establishing a central institution in London for the distribution
of Cowpox matter, which bill in all appearance will pass; and this
disgusting and degrading remedy will cost the nation another
£4,000 or £5,000 annually, though it has been clearly proved not
to have answered the purpose intended. This, however, I regard
as cheap when compared with the menace of Mr. Fuller, who, in
the debate, proposed a compulsory law on the subject. He took
up the old idea of Mr. Wilberforce, who was for a law to prevent
parents from having their children inoculated with Smallpox unless
they chose to send them to pest-houses, or to some place at a considerable
distance from any other habitations. This cruel and
tyrannical proposition I opposed at the time; and I am happy to
perceive that it is now almost universally exploded.</p></div>

<p>Whilst Cobbett could not arrest the action of Parliament,
he was short-sighted in considering that the proposed
endowment of vaccination was merely a question
of the loss of a few thousands a year. We are saddled
with vaccination at this day, its costs and mischiefs, by
reason of the vote for the National Vaccine Establishment
in 1808. As soon as an annual subsidy is placed
on the estimates, interests are created, which not only
perpetuate themselves, but constantly tend to enlargement;
and such interests, once created, can only be got
rid of when proved useless by agitation out of doors and
persistent pressure on the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Referring to a notorious outbreak of smallpox among
a vaccinated population at Ringwood in Hampshire,
Cobbett continued&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should like to have heard Mr. Rose’s statement of the circumstances
at Ringwood, whence, he says, it is evident that the failure
arose “from the use of <em>improper matter</em>.” That many persons,
who had been inoculated with Cowpox, caught Smallpox and died
at Ringwood, is a fact that even the Royal Jennerian Society
cannot deny; and this being the case, what man in his senses will
put any faith in the efficacy of Cowpox as a preventive of Smallpox?
<em>The thing is done.</em> It <em>has failed</em>, and it is vain to endeavour
to prop up its reputation; for, in a few years, it will become
proverbial as humbug.</p></div>

<p>A prophecy, it will be said, that has not been fulfilled.
True: but in Cobbett’s time it advanced far to fulfilment.
All the unqualified promises under which vaccination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
was brought into practice, were one by one surrendered
under the compulsion of experience. The mass of the
people remained unvaccinated; the zeal for vaccinating
the poor abated; and the practice continued among the
middle and upper classes on the humblest pretexts&mdash;as
something that might hinder or mitigate smallpox, and
in any case do little harm. We have to recollect that
the mania for vaccination which now prevails is a revival
of a prescription which our forefathers had tested and
found wanting. Vaccination fell into neglect, not because
there was indifference to smallpox, but because it did not
prevent that disease.</p>

<p>The excuse for the first failures of vaccination was,
that spurious cowpox must have been employed&mdash;spurious
cowpox being the artful invention of Jenner to cover
disasters; artful, and yet absurd, for how could cowpox
exist spuriously any more than smallpox? The precise
fact, that spurious cowpox was the dodge of an unscrupulous
quack was unknown to Cobbett, but he was
sharp enough to recognise imposture, and thus wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pretext of <em>spurious matter</em> is the weakest defence that ever
was set up, because it is evident that such will always be an excuse.
The Methodist pike who told his shoal of gudgeons that <em>if they
had faith</em>, they might jump into a chalk pit without so much as
spraining their ankles, answered all their reproaches with saying,
that their broken bones were owing to their own sin in not having
faith, and referred, for proof, to one among them who had accidentally
escaped unhurt. All who catch Smallpox and die have
been Cowpoxed with spurious matter, and all who have not yet
caught Smallpox, after the Cowpox operation, have had the pure
matter; and so it will be, to be sure, to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p><em>Who</em> is to collect this genuine matter, and <em>whence</em> is it to come?
Who shall tell whether he inoculate with Cowpox or King’s Evil?
Or with many other disorders, one of which I will not name, but
which I do hope, that fathers and mothers who have given their
children that greatest of blessing, a pure stream of blood, will not
forget when they are about to cause that blood to be impregnated
with matter taken from the ulcerous bodies of others.</p></div>

<p>In this latter warning, we have to remark Cobbett’s
prescience. He knew that it was impossible to transfer
organic virus from arm-to-arm without transferring more
than was intended, inclusive of the dreadful disease he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
indicated. Vaccinators naturally denied the possibility
of such extra transmission; for if they had admitted the
possibility, they must have ceased to vaccinate. M.
Ricord has put the alternative plainly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The obvious fact is, that if ever the transmission of this disease
with vaccine lymph is clearly demonstrated, <em>Vaccination must be
altogether discontinued</em>.</p></div>

<p>The clear demonstration demanded by M. Ricord has
been abundantly supplied; and what at one time was
conveniently considered questionable, is now openly
confessed. Mr. Brudenell Carter, writing in the <cite>Medical
Examiner</cite>, 24th May, 1877, testifies&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I think that syphilitic contamination by vaccine lymph is by no
means an unusual occurrence, and that it is very generally overlooked
because people do not know either when or where to look
for it. I think that a large proportion of the cases of apparently
inherited syphilis are in reality vaccinal; and that the syphilis in
these cases does not show itself until the age of from eight to ten
years, by which time the relation between cause and effect is apt
to be lost sight of.</p></div>

<p>And we have Sir Thomas Watson’s memorable declaration
in the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, June, 1878&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I can readily sympathise with, and even applaud, a father who,
with the presumed dread or misgiving in his mind, is willing to
submit to multiplied judicial penalties rather than expose his child
to the risk of an infection so ghastly.</p></div>

<p>Thus belated, thus after infinite mischief to the public
health, the Nestor of Medicine appears and solemnly
allows that the warning of William Cobbett, given
seventy years before, was a true warning, and that
worthy of praise are the wise parents who give it heed.</p>

<p>Cobbett, grateful for escape from compulsory vaccination,
overlooked, I said, the danger perpetuated through
the endowment of the practice. He was overjoyed at
Canning’s emphatic declaration, that “he could not
imagine any circumstances whatever that would induce
him to follow up the most favourable report of the
infallibility of vaccination with any measure for its
compulsory infliction.” Hence he continued&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am glad to perceive that the Ministry took care to intimate
their decided hostility to any law for propagating Cowpox by <em>force</em>,
by the aid of <em>pains</em> and <em>penalties</em>. This being the case, I care
little about Mr. Rose and his Cowpox Institution. Those who
choose to have their children impregnated from that shop, will be
at liberty to do so; and those who wish to avoid it, may. This is
all right; though it may be very foolish for Government to interfere
in such a matter. I think we may thank the events at Ringwood
for the ministerial protest against compulsory measures. It
would have been curious enough to see people paying penalties
for being so obstinate as not to consult their own health, or that of
their children.</p></div>

<p>What Cobbett thought would be “curious enough” we
witness daily. English liberty, if it has advanced in
some directions, has gone back in others since Cobbett
wrote. Parents are now haled before magistrates, fined
and imprisoned, because (knowing that vaccination
cannot avert smallpox, whilst it may seriously injure
the health of their children, and even cost them their
lives) they refuse to submit to the infliction. Never,
perhaps, was there a more impious invasion of liberty
than compulsory vaccination, and yet we have free and
enlightened Englishmen who excuse and defend it!
These are the Pharisees of Liberalism, blatant over
tyranny, extinct or foreign, but dull to similar tyranny
within their own domain. They garnish the sepulchres
of the prophets of freedom, but (in their petty measure)
repeat the deeds of those who persecuted and slew them.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the article from which I have been quoting,
Cobbett assumed that the resort to the House of Commons
for money was evidence that the enthusiasm for
vaccination was abating. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The present application to Parliament is a pretty good proof
that Cowpox is beginning to be <em>blowed upon</em>. The Royal Jennerian
Society <em>wants funds</em>. The subscribers have fallen off; and so
application to the public purse has become necessary. <em>Why</em> have
the subscribers fallen off? Their <em>humanity</em> has not waxed cold.
It were slander, indeed, to suppose that. But I suspect that
their <em>faith</em> has waxed cold; and when that is the case, zeal soon
slackens its operations, more especially when these operations consist
chiefly in the expenditure of money.</p></div>

<p>The fact was, that as vaccination failures multiplied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Jenner tried, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more suo</i>, to make a scape-goat of Walker,
the Resident Inoculator of the Royal Jennerian Society.
There was a dreadful row, and a secession of the better
part of the members with Walker, who set up the London
Vaccine Institution. Those who adhered to Jenner
were not of the philanthropic and subscribing order, but
they had political influence, and used it to get rid of
their liabilities, first in obtaining a vote of £20,000 for
Jenner, and second in the establishment of a National
Vaccine Establishment with a subsidy of £3,000 a year.</p>

<p>So far Cobbett in his <cite>Register</cite>, where he had no occasion
to discuss vaccination again; but toward the end
of his life, 1829-30, he produced a series of papers entitled
<cite>Advice to Young Men</cite>, in which he reiterated and
enforced his protest against the Jennerian imposture&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I contend [he wrote] that the beastly application could not, in
nature, be efficacious in preventing Smallpox, the truth of which
assertion has now been proved in thousands upon thousands of
instances. For a long time, for ten years, the contrary was
boldly and brazenly asserted.... But Smallpox, in its worst
form, broke out at Ringwood, and carried off, I believe (I have not
the account at hand), more than a hundred persons, young and
old, <em>every one of whom had had the Cowpox “so nicely.”</em> And what
was then said? Was the quackery exploded? Not at all: the
failure was imputed to <em>unskilful operators</em>: to the <em>staleness of
the matter</em>: to its not being of the <em>genuine quality</em>. Admitting all
this, the scheme stood condemned; for the great advantages held
forth were, that <em>anybody</em> might perform the operation, and that
the matter was everywhere abundant and cost free.</p>

<p>But these were paltry excuses: the mere shuffles of quackery;
for what do we know now? Why, that in <em>hundreds</em> of instances,
persons Cowpoxed by <span class="smcap">Jenner himself</span>, have taken the real Smallpox
afterwards, and have either died from the disorder or narrowly
escaped with their lives! I will mention two instances. The
first is Sir Richard Phillips, whose son, several years after Jenner
had given him the insuring matter, had a very hard struggle for
life, under the hands of the old-fashioned, seam-giving, and
dimple-dipping Smallpox. The second is Philip Codd, Esq., of
Rumstead Court, near Maidstone, whose son had a very narrow
escape under the real Smallpox, and who also had been Cowpoxed
<em>by Jenner himself</em>. Mr. Codd I have known, and have most
sincerely respected, from the time of our both being eighteen years
of age. When the young gentleman, his son, was very young, I,
having him on my knee one day, asked his kind and excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
mother whether he had been <em>inoculated</em>. “Oh, no!” said she,
“we are going to have him <em>vaccinated</em>.” Whereupon I, going
into the garden to the father, said, “I do hope, Codd, that you are
not going to have that beastly cow-stuff put into that fine boy.”
“Why,” said he, “you see, Cobbett, it is to be done by <em>Jenner
himself</em>.” What answer I gave, what names and epithets I bestowed
upon Jenner and his quackery, I will leave the reader to
imagine.</p>

<p>Now, here are instances enough; but every reader has heard of,
if not seen, scores of others. Young Mr. Codd caught Smallpox at
a school; and if I recollect rightly, there were several other vaccinated
youths who did the same at the same time. Quackery,
however, has always a shuffle left. Now that Cowpox has been
proved to be no guarantee against Smallpox, it makes it <em>milder</em>
when it comes! A pretty shuffle, indeed, this! You are to be
all your life in fear of it, having as your sole consolation, that when
it comes (and it may overtake you in a camp or on the seas) it
will be milder! It was not too mild to kill at Ringwood, and its
mildness, in the case of young Mr. Codd, did not restrain it from
blinding him for a suitable number of days.</p>

<p>I shall not easily forget the alarm and anxiety of Mr. and Mrs.
Codd on this occasion&mdash;both of them the best of parents, and both
of them punished for having yielded to fashionable quackery. I
will not say <em>justly</em> punished; for affection for their children, in
which respect they were never surpassed by any parents on earth,
was the cause of their listening to the danger-obviating quackery.
This, too, is the case with other parents; but parents should be
under the influence of <em>reason</em> and <em>experience</em>, as well as under that
of affection; and <em>now</em>, at any rate, they ought to set this really
dangerous quackery at naught.</p></div>

<p>Such was Cobbett’s case against vaccination, and I
ask, Was he not justified in his opposition? He saw
vaccination introduced to the world as an infallible preventive
of smallpox, and he lived to see the claim gradually
minimised until reduced to that of making smallpox
milder! Even thus abated, he had to stigmatise the
claim as a last shuffle of quackery. It is asserted to this
day, that vaccination makes smallpox milder, but the
pretence is exploded whenever we demand, How do you
know? In any case, or in any number of cases of smallpox,
Who can define the severity that has been reduced
by vaccination? any more than if I were to assert that
vaccination intensifies smallpox, it would be impossible
to confute me. We can only meet unverifiable assertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
with indifference or contempt. If it pleases people to
believe in metempsychosis or the constitution of the
moon in green cheese, the wise leave them to the enjoyment
of their humour. On the other hand, I have to
remark, that smallpox is a disease of wide range of
intensity, from an ailment almost trivial to one invariably
fatal; and this wide range of intensity was as characteristic
of the disease before as since the introduction
of vaccination. On what pretext then are mild cases of
smallpox attributed to the influence of vaccination?
There are mild and malignant cases of smallpox alike
among the vaccinated and unvaccinated, and not unfrequently
when the vaccinated and unvaccinated are found
in approximate conditions, as in the same household, it is
the unvaccinated who are most lightly afflicted, or who
make the better recovery.</p>

<p>It often helps to a clearer apprehension of a position if
we endeavour to conceive its opposite. We have seen
Cobbett as an opponent of vaccination: let us try to
think of him as its advocate. Suppose he had joined
with the polite and educated mob in hailing Jenner as
the saviour of mankind from smallpox, and assured the
readers of the <cite>Register</cite> that they would be secure from
the disease for ever if inoculated with cowpox&mdash;an easy
and harmless operation. Then after a while imagine
him reporting that he had been misled&mdash;that the operation
was not so easy as represented, nor always so harmless.
By and bye he would be the bearer of a more
serious revelation. Some of the vaccinated, warranted
secure, had taken smallpox, but such misadventures,
he would explain, were due to the use of a wrong sort of
cowpox, of which there was a spurious variety. But the
suggestion of spurious cowpox creating alarm and discouragement
of vaccination, it would be necessary for
him to counteract the declaration with the avowal that
by spurious cowpox was not meant spurious cowpox, but
simply irregularities in the action of the genuine virus
on the arms of the vaccinated. But even these excuses
would be insufficient. It was not difficult to ascribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
smallpox after vaccination to careless practice, or to
virus that was not the right sort of cowpox; but when
smallpox was found to occur in numerous instances after
Jenner’s own vaccinations and those of the most accomplished
practitioners, What was to be said? Why, what
was said, that when vaccination did not prevent smallpox,
it made it milder!</p>

<p>Imagine, if we can, Cobbett’s honest and vigorous
intelligence retreating through this slush of apology and
prevarication! Yet through such slush every follower
of Jenner had to trudge.</p>

<p>I am not intent on setting Cobbett forth as a model of
wisdom. I simply maintain that his common-sense was
adequate to the judgment of vaccination, and that it was
correctly exercised. Of physiology and hygiene he was
as ignorant as his contemporaries; but if a lotion were
sold to prevent toothache, and it did not prevent toothache,
it would be safe to denounce its vendors as quacks,
even though the vendors happened to be the Royal
College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons.
The causes of disease were unconsidered in Cobbett’s
days. It was not asked why people suffered from smallpox
and other fevers, nor whether fevers were avoidable.
Such maladies were accepted like bad weather,
and encountered by medical dodges, or by charms like
vaccination, the more irrational and nasty being taken
for the more effective. Cobbett himself, if he did not
believe in vaccination, believed in inoculation with smallpox.
He had his children poxed in infancy, and when
he argued against vaccination, it was in the confident
possession of a surer prophylactic. Taking smallpox for
a probable calamity that could only occur once in a lifetime,
it seemed to him expedient to incur the disease
when convenient, and to have done with the dread of it.
How far he was mistaken in this course I need not stay to
debate. Suffice it to say, that he thought he could make
sure that smallpox was smallpox, whilst what cowpox
might be none could tell, especially after transmission
through arms and constitution unnumbered and unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The causes of smallpox, I said, were unconsidered in
Cobbett’s days. It never even entered into Jenner’s
head that the disease might be a consequence of bad
conditions of life; nor did he try to explain why the
malady was on the decrease ere he appeared with his
magical prescription. The decrease was claimed for
vaccination, but it had set in before vaccination was
heard of, and was continued among those who never
received it. No sanitary improvements had been effected
to account for the abatement of the disease. To what,
then, was it due? I answer, in part at least, to a progressive
change in the diet of the people&mdash;to the substitution
of tea for malt liquors, and to the displacement
of arid fare by potatoes. The food of city folk up to the
close of last century was closely akin to that of men at
sea, and their scorbutic habit of body was notorious&mdash;a
habit that rendered acute or chronic whatever disorders
they were subject to. The remedy came of inclination
and necessity rather than of intention. Tea was instinctively
preferred by women, and the dearness of
provisions compelled resort to the potato, easily grown
and grateful to the palate as a mitigant of the saltness
of beef, bacon, and fish. If any are disposed to dispute
the fact of this revolution in the popular dietary, they
may be referred to Cobbett. He witnessed the change,
and persistently denounced it. Tea-drinking was to
him an abomination. It was a slatternly indulgence,
costly to the poor, and innutritious. Potatoes were as
detestable. They were trash as compared with bread;
wasteful, dirty, and unfit to satisfy a man’s appetite. It
is true that tea and potatoes are poor forms of food, but
the one as a substitute for beer, and the other as an
antiscorbutic, were eminently useful. It is not said that
smallpox is caused or prevented by food, proper or improper,
but that the character of food may predispose to
disease, and intensify it; as is manifest on ship-board.
Hence it is (in the absence of other adequate influences)
that I am disposed to ascribe the abatement of smallpox
which set in toward the close of last century to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
better blood of the people ameliorated by that increased
consumption of tea and potatoes, against which Cobbett
so blindly and vainly testified.</p>

<p>A last word about Cobbett. His prejudices had nearly
always a creditable root. He hated potatoes because
they were strenuously recommended by Wilberforce and
other good and goody people as cheap food for the poor.
Cobbett’s contention was, that not cheap food, but
political justice was the true remedy for popular misery.
It was very nice of Wilberforce and his friends to be
kind to the poor, but, said Cobbett, if they were first
just, the poor might dispense with their kindness. If
the poor had their own, they might have beer instead of
tea, and bread and beef and bacon instead of potatoes,
with much else besides. Cobbett was often enough in
error, but behind all his perversities lay ardent good-will
for the welfare of the greatest number of his countrymen;
and the consideration now enjoyed by the working
classes is largely due to his dauntless spirit and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'un-unwearied exertions'">unwearied

<span class="chap-hdr">THE GROSVENOR CASE.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">It may be asked, Why, if Vaccination was proved
useless and injurious, was it not entirely discontinued?
but the question implies a logical consistency which is
rarely exemplified in human experience. Vaccination
was discontinued, but it was not entirely discontinued:
it was chiefly continued among the upper and middle
classes where fees were to be had for its performance.
It was admitted that the rite might not prevent smallpox,
but it would make it milder. The last thing a
medicine man admits is, that he is helpless and can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
nothing. Even in presence of that for which there is
no remedy, it tends to his importance, and the satisfaction
of the patient, and those around the patient, to make
believe to do something. Now for smallpox, there was
no preventive. Its causes were unknown. It broke out,
and it disappeared, none knew how. Jenner’s household
was devastated with fever, but he never asked, why? As
observed disease was accepted like so much bad weather.
Whether fevers were avoidable, or whether they were
consequences of ill living, were questions as yet outside
cognizance. The predominant thought about smallpox
was, that it might be dodged, be it from God or devil.
Inoculation with smallpox was a dodge with disagreeable
accompaniments: inoculation with cowpox was a dodge
on easier terms: by a trick, that left every evil circumstance
unaffected, smallpox was to be got rid of. In the
nature of things, the dodge was ineffective&mdash;mercifully
ineffective; for who that is wise would care to have the
consequences of evil abated save by the putting away of
evil? The dodge proved illusory in the presence of those
who recommended it, but whilst a manifest failure as to
the main intention, they had the craft to shift its efficacy
to rendering the disease milder&mdash;a claim as to which no
test was immediately available. Moreover, vaccination
had the merit of action, which the quack, whether lay or
professional, insists on at all hazards. To confess ignorance
and inability is self-denial for which the quack’s
mind is unequal, as whoever is ailing and has friends
may perceive. All come bearing advice and prescriptions
for the control of nature, when, with simple quiescence
and a right disposition of circumstances, nature is instant
to effect recovery.</p>

<p>The failures of vaccination to prevent smallpox were
chiefly visible among the poor, smallpox being predominantly
an affliction of poverty; but in 1811 a case
occurred in aristocratic life which produced more talk
and dismay than scores of similar cases among trades-folk
and artizans. Robert Grosvenor, son of Earl Grosvenor,
vaccinated by Jenner in 1801 when a puny babe of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
month old, fell ill on 26th May, 1811; in a few days
smallpox developed, became confluent, and the lad
narrowly escaped with life. There was no mistake about
the vaccination; the mark on the boy’s arm indicated
“the perfect disease”; he was attended by Sir Henry
Halford and Sir Walter Farquhar, and was visited by
Jenner, who happened to be in town; and, in short, the
evidence of the impotence of vaccination to avert smallpox
was complete and indisputable. The commotion was
intense, and in a letter from Jenner to Baron we see how
it affected his mind. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cockspur Street, Charing Cross</span>,<br />
<span class="padr4"><em>11th June, 1811</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;It will probably be my lot to be detained in
this horrible place some days longer. It has unfortunately
happened, that a failure in vaccination has appeared in the family
of a nobleman here; and, more unfortunately still, in a child vaccinated
by me. The noise and confusion this case has created are
not to be described. The vaccine lancet is sheathed; and the long
concealed variolous blade ordered to come forth. Charming!
This will soon cure the mania. The Town is a fool&mdash;an idiot; and
will continue in this red-hot&mdash;hissing-hot state about this affair,
till something else starts up to draw aside its attention. I am
determined to lock up my brains, and think no more <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro bono
publico</i>; and I advise you, my friend, to do the same; for we are
sure to get nothing but abuse for it. It is my intention to collect
all the cases I can of Smallpox after supposed security from that
disease. In this undertaking I hope to derive much assistance
from you. The best plan will be to push out some of them as soon
as possible. This would not be necessary on account of the present
case, but it will prove the best shield to protect us from the past,
and from those which are to come.&mdash;Ever yours, <span class="smcap">Edward Jenner</span>.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p></div>

<p>The defence, therefore, was, that as an attack of smallpox
did not always avert a second attack, it was not
reasonable to expect that vaccination should be more
effective; and to make good this position, a diligent search
was instituted for cases of repeated smallpox. Many
were found, though they were generally regarded as
rarities, whilst their reality was frequently disputed; but
whatever their number or genuineness, they were insignificant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
in comparison with the instances of smallpox
subsequent to vaccination. Moreover, the Jennerites
were taunted with their late discovery of smallpox after
smallpox. Why had they not stated from the outset
that smallpox might follow vaccination as smallpox
followed smallpox? Why, on the contrary, had they
asserted vaccination to be an absolute and life-long
defence against smallpox? Why had they abused as
fools or denounced as liars all the early reporters of
smallpox after vaccination? And why did it require
evidence, that could not possibly be wriggled out of, to
bring them to an acknowledgment of the truth?</p>

<p>But even in presence of such evidence, Jenner persisted
in his asseverations as if he had lost the very sense of
truth. Writing to Miss Calcraft on 19th June, 1811, he
actually claimed that he had foreseen and predicted such
disasters as had occurred in the Grosvenor family! Here
are his words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Take a comprehensive view of Vaccination, and then ask yourself
what is this case? You will find it a speck, a mere microscopic
speck on the page which contains the history of the vaccine discovery.
In the very first thing I wrote upon the subject, and
many times since, I have said the occurrence of such an event
should excite no surprise; because the Cowpox must possess
preternatural powers if it would give uniform security to the
constitution, when it is well known that Smallpox cannot; for
we have more than one thousand cases to prove the contrary, and
fortunately seventeen of them in the families of the nobility.</p></div>

<p>Obviously had such been his uniform testimony, the
Grosvenor incident would have excited neither surprise
nor alarm; and mark this additional hardihood&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Indeed, I have often said it was wonderful that I should have
gone on for such a series of years vaccinating so many thousands,
many under very unfavourable circumstances, without meeting
with any interruption to my success before. And now this single
solitary instance has occurred, all my past labours are forgotten,
and I am held up by many, perhaps the majority of the higher
classes, as an object of derision and contempt.... What if ten,
fifty, or a hundred such events should occur? they will be balanced
a hundred times over by those of a similar kind after Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Whilst thus he maintained that it was far more extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
that young Grosvenor had smallpox after vaccination
than that others should have smallpox after
smallpox, he went on to assert that vaccination had saved
the lad’s life!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The child would have died (that is universally allowed) but for
the previous Vaccination. There was but little secondary fever;
the pustules were sooner in going off than in ordinary cases; and,
indeed, the whole progress of the disease was different. It was
modified and mitigated, and the boy was saved.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p></div>

<p>Such was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot d’ ordre</i>. If Grosvenor had not
been vaccinated, he would have perished! The National
Vaccine Board reported on the case to the same effect,
and the faithful suffered themselves to be re-assured.</p>

<p>In connection with 1811 and London smallpox, there
is a letter to Dr. Lettsom which throws still farther light
on Jenner’s temper and philosophy. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cheltenham</span>, <em>22nd November, 1811</em>.</p>

<p>I have considered London as the centre of opposition to the
vaccine practice; but even there, in spite of the base and murderous
designs of a few bad minded individuals, the Smallpox has wonderfully
decreased; and in the provinces its mortality has lessened in
a still greater proportion. For the great and grand effects of
Vaccination the eye must quit this little spot, and survey it among
other European countries, and still more particularly among the
vast empires of Asia and America. In Mexico and Peru the disease
is nearly extinct. The documents which pour in upon me from
these distant regions fill me with inexpressible delight. You shall
have copies when I can get them transcribed.</p>

<p>The chief impediments to the general adoption of Vaccination
in England are, I am confident, our newspapers and some of our
magazines. Whenever a case of what is called failure starts up, in
it goes to a newspaper, with all the exaggeration with which envy
and malice can garnish it.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p></div>

<p>Was there ever a more delicious bit of self-revelation!
The wicked newspapers! The base, murderous and bad
minded enemies of vaccination! The smallpox of London
reduced by vicarious vaccination in spite of its ingratitude!
The consolation derived from the survey of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
countries of Europe and the vast empires of Asia and
America with inexpressible delight from Mexico and
Peru! Not Mrs. Jellyby herself lost in an atmosphere
of Borrioboola-Gah is more piquant.</p>

<p class="noindent">Jenner’s references to the good effects of vaccination in
London were curiously inconsistent. That vaccination
in which he professed to rejoice was chiefly the work of
Dr. John Walker, whose practice he had denounced as
so widely at variance with what he considered correct,
that even the wreck of the Royal Jennerian Society was
not thought too heavy a price to pay for deliverance
from complicity with him. The London Vaccine Institution,
established in 1806 by Walker and his friends, was
responsible for the large majority of vaccinations effected
in the metropolis. Walker was a pure enthusiast, of
boundless energy, with a craze for vaccinating. Adverse
results had no effect upon him: he did not deny, but
simply did not recognise them, and held on prophesying
and practising with mechanical persistency. Nevertheless,
he ran aground. The income of the Institution had
dwindled to less than £100 a year when Andrew Johnstone,
a Cumberland man, a school-fellow of Walker,
came to his assistance. With a commercial eye he surveyed
the situation. He perceived that though vaccination
had fallen into disrepute, there remained many
believers who only required stirring up and solicitation
to provide funds to keep Walker going and to yield the
collector a satisfactory commission. As the Royal
Jennerian Society had ceased to exist for any active
purpose in 1810, nothing remaining “but a Patronage,
a Presidency, and an unorganised body of Subscribers
and Governors,” it occurred to him that it would be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
policy to annex these to the revived enterprise, and in due
course a union was effected, and the <span class="smcap">London Vaccine
Institution and Royal Jennerian Society</span> became
the title to conjure with. An attempt was made to
secure Jenner for President, but that was too bold a
stroke. He thus answered the application&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cheltenham</span>, <em>3rd September, 1813</em>.</p>

<p>Although it must be evident that every institution which has for
its object the extension of Vaccine Inoculation, must have my best
wishes for its success, yet, for reasons which on reflection must be
obvious, you must see the impossibility of my accepting the offered
appointment.</p></div>

<p>Highly impressive were the Reports of the reconstituted
Institution under the patronage of the Corporation
of the City of London with the City Arms on the
covers. Subsequently the King, George IV., appeared as
patron, and the City Arms gave place to the Royal
Arms. Among the presidents were the Archbishop of
Canterbury, four or five Dukes (one of them Wellington),
half a dozen Marquises and as many Bishops, about a
score of Earls, with M.P.’s and pious and philanthropic
notables many. So much was due to the tact of Andrew
Johnstone, who understood the use of names, who never
dropped one of the least influence, and, spite of Jenner’s
ill-will, dealt with his honours and countenance as though
they belonged to the Institution. Business is business,
he would have said, and holds no reckoning with pique
and dislike. Nevertheless the financial results did not
correspond with the overpowering patronage. The
income of the Institution never attained £1000 a year,
whilst the bills for advertising and printing sometimes
approached £500. In the Report for 1827 we find the
operations thus summarised&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>The income of the Institution in 1826 was £620 15s.,
and the expenditure £715 12s., leaving a deficit of
£94 17s.</p>

<p>The figures are interesting, for they afford some idea
of the extent of London vaccination during a quarter of
a century. The operations of the Vaccine Institution
lay chiefly among the poor&mdash;the vast majority in London
as in every city; and if we allow that in the course of
five-and-twenty years, 350,000, in a population of upwards
of 1,000,000 in the flux of life and death, were
operated on, we give a liberal estimate in favour of
vaccination. That even so many could have much effect
on the prevalence of smallpox (except for aggravation) is
incredible, unless the vicarious action of vaccination be
seriously asserted. Turning over Walker’s report it is
amusing to observe how any abatement in London
smallpox was attributed to vaccination, and any increase
to its neglect&mdash;an ingenuous exemplification of the fable
of the Fly and the Wheel.</p>

<p>The appointed inoculators of the Institution were a
numerous body&mdash;250 names and addresses are given
in one of the Reports. They were chiefly London
tradesmen with a taste for doing what they thought
“good.” As vaccination came to be regarded as professional
work, these “unqualified practitioners” gave
cause for offence, but Walker held stoutly to his
opinion, which he shared with Jenner, that vaccination
might be performed by any man or woman. In
Walker’s words, “It is easier to perform the whole
business of vaccination than it is to thread a needle&mdash;yea,
it is easier.”</p>

<p>The annexation of the remains of the Royal Jennerian
Society by Walker was much disliked by Jenner and
his associates; and when the revived enterprise showed
signs of prosperity, their dislike developed to open
enmity, and John Ring’s services as bravo and satirist
were called into requisition. He first tried his hand,
anonymously, in a volume of doggerel, published in 1815,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
entitled <cite>The Vaccine Scourge</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> in which Walker is represented
as singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">I am a jolly beggar,</p>
<p class="verse2">From Cockermouth I came;</p>
<p class="verse0">I do pretend to be a Friend,</p>
<p class="verse2">John Walker is my name;</p>
<p class="verse0">And a-begging we will go, will go, will go,</p>
<p class="verse0">And a-begging we will go.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The verses, extending over a hundred pages, are wretched
stuff, vulgar and malevolent, and a few extracts from
the Preface will indicate the animus of the entire performance.
Ring’s assumption was, first, that Walker
was a rogue from whom the public required to be protected;
second, that his Institution was superfluous; and
third, that if greater facilities for vaccination were
wanted in London, it should be left to the Government
to provide them&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These hints may serve to warn the public. Dr. Walker is an
artful, avaricious, and ambitious man; but let him be cautious
how he acts when he tries to exercise his art, to glut his avarice,
and to gratify his ambition. Let him recollect what was inscribed
on the tombstone of an infamous scoundrel&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry fs80">
<p class="verseq">“Lie still if you’re wise;</p>
<p class="verse0">You’ll be damned if you rise.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">We recommend him and his accomplices not to try to obtain
money by false pretences. A Vaccine Institution has long been
established by the Legislature, where, as well as at other Institutions,
matter may be procured free of expense; and no one who has
much zeal in the cause of Vaccination will find much difficulty in
procuring it. If farther aid is necessary, let it be granted by
Parliament, and not to a set of swindlers. It is not meet to take
the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.</p></div>

<p>Many of the agents of the London Vaccine Institution
were chemists and apothecaries, and these, according to
Ring, had an interest in the propagation of smallpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To exterminate Smallpox by means of chemists and apothecaries,
the greatest friends of Smallpox, is to cast out devils by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. You might as well expect a
foxhunter to destroy the breed of foxes, or a ratcatcher to exterminate
the race of rats.</p></div>

<p>The <cite>Vaccine Scourge</cite> producing little effect, Ring returned
to the charge in the following year, 1816, with <cite>A
Caution against Vaccine Swindlers and Imposters</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The <cite>Caution</cite> is a series of libels, the puerility and extravagance
of which were their own nullification. A motto
was taken from the <cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite> for the title-page,
as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Jennerian discovery has shed a brilliant lustre on our era;
but unfortunately, the discovery has been in a great degree rendered
abortive by <em>bastard institutions</em>, created for the purpose of filling
the pockets of <em>a set of adventurers, without education</em>, and <em>destitute
of principle</em>. We could name several wretches who have
fattened, and are still fattening, on such jobs.</p></div>

<p>Ring delivered his mind unequivocally. Walker was
an imposter, and the London Vaccine Institution prospered
by his frauds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a Society in this Metropolis [he wrote], falsely calling
itself the Royal Jennerian Society, which has been collecting
subscriptions to a considerable amount under that assumed name;
and thus collecting money under false pretences.</p>

<p>An eminent physician speaking of this Society and its successful
state, called it a successful villany; and villany is not the less
villany because it is successful.</p>

<p>It has also been organising a complete system of quackery, by
granting diplomas to persons totally ignorant of the first principles
of the medical profession, which will add to the present host of
empirics.</p>

<p>No one can now pass along the streets without being annoyed
with the inscription, <span class="smcap">Vaccination Gratis under the sanction of
the London Vaccine Institution</span> in one pane of glass, <span class="smcap">Macassar
Oil</span> in a second, and <span class="smcap">Patent Blacking</span> in a third. In short
Vaccination is now <em>quite a drug</em>.</p></div>

<p>These were words of envy and malice, and came with
odious inconsistency from the spokesman of Jenner, who
had instructed and encouraged his acquaintances, male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and female, to practise vaccination. We may, however,
take Ring’s evidence as to Walker’s activity in
London&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Walker glories in his chemical, galenical, pharmaceutical,
and dentrifical inoculators; and boasts that they exceed in number
those of any other vaccine institution; but he glories in his shame.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non numerentur, sed ponderentur.</i> They are springing up under
every pestle and mortar, and barber’s pole, like mushrooms in a
hot-bed, from Hyde-Park Corner to Whitechapel, and from Whitechapel
to Blackwall. It is the duty of every regular practitioner
to expose such imposters, and to encourage such exposure. It is,
in fact, the rescuing of life from fraudulent and rapacious hands.</p>

<p>One of his inoculators is Mr. Campbell, who cures all sorts of
incurable diseases with <em>Elephants’ Milk</em>. He says he recently
sent 20,000 bottles to Russia at 11s. each. He also sells the Milk
in pills at 2s. 9d. a box. The poor have the Milk at half-price;
and strict secresy is preserved.</p>

<p>In Walker’s Plan for 1814, it appears that he grants his diplomas
to those who <em>are not</em>, as well as to those who <em>are</em>, of the medical
profession, and that Inoculators in the country are requested and
<em>authorised</em> to put up a board with the following inscription,
<span class="smcap">Protection from Smallpox under the sanction of the London
Vaccine Institution</span>. Then is to follow the name of the farrier,
cobbler, barber, barber-surgeon, apothecary, man-midwife, tooth-drawer,
druggist, chemist, oil-man, cheesemonger, drysalter, or
grocer, who dispenses the blessing of Vaccination gratuitously.</p>

<p>The motley crew thus appointed are directed to make an Annual
Return of the numbers inoculated by them in order to swell Dr.
Walker’s list; and such inoculators are not in general very nice
in their calculations. Many of them will, in all probability, like
other quacks, pretend to a hundred times more than they really
perform.</p></div>

<p>Those who continued to believe that Vaccination was an
easy and harmless operation, could see nothing but good
management in the multiplication of Walker’s agencies,
nor anything but meanness in Ring’s sneers at tradesmen.
His assertion that the use of the title of the Royal
Jennerian Society was fraudulent, had no justification,
yet it was his persistent reproach&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Honesty is the best policy. I therefore sincerely advise Dr.
Walker and his Board, to assume no more the title of the Royal
Jennerian Society, to which they must know they have not the
least claim, lest they should be brought before the Lord Mayor as
swindlers, and be prosecuted for obtaining money under false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
pretences. I am informed that they have already been compelled
to refund a legacy of £100; and it is to be hoped they will be compelled
to refund the rest of their ill-gotten store.</p></div>

<p>Lastly, he appealed to the members of the Jennerian
Society, demanding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How long will they suffer their names to be prostituted, and the
public to be deluded by a set of swindlers and imposters; by men
who are neither dignified by their rank, nor distinguished by their
talents; by a set of daring adventurers and despicable upstarts!
It is a gross insult and indignity, to which no man of the least
sense of honour, or of shame, would submit.</p></div>

<p>But they did submit, and why not? Enthusiasm for
Vaccination had passed away. It had been found out;
it was everywhere distrusted; and those who held by it
had to see it pushed on the same terms as any other
quack prescription. What then was there to object to in
Walker s procedure? The reason for Ring’s libels lay in
Jenner’s jealousy. Walker was Jenner’s abhorrence.
He had joined in the conspiracy to oust Walker from the
Jennerian Society in 1806, but the operation proved
fatal to the Society, whilst Walker conveyed the confidence
and subscriptions of the faithful to his new Institution.
What wonder, then, that Jenner disliked the
eccentric Quaker! Even worse; Walker accurately
appraised Jenner’s share in “the vaccine discovery,”
which came, he said, from Jenner as a hint, and was
developed by Pearson and Woodville in practice&mdash;a fact
that was as gall and wormwood to Jenner. Moreover,
Walker had written a Jenneric Opera in which Jenner
was represented as a country apothecary riding up to
London on a cow, and going round a-begging among the
nobility and gentry. Wherefore says Ring&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As to the calumny and detraction which Dr. Jenner and his
friends have received at the hands of that desperate adventurer in
his Jenneric Opera and elsewhere, they are content to bear it, provided
he will not again use the language of flattery toward them;
nor lavish his encomiums on them in that polluted channel, the
Medical Journal. His resentment can do very little harm, which
is more than can be said of his adulation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“It is the slaver kills, and not the bite!”</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>Ring was an awkward champion. He sneered at
Walker’s diplomas certifying fitness to act as vaccinator&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They will have the same authority [he said] and the same
virtue as a diploma from the University of St. Andrews; and in
all probability will in a short time be sold at the same price&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Forgetful that it was from St. Andrews that Jenner purchased
his M.D.!</p>

<p>With equal recklessness, he denounced Walker as a
vaccinator, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He tells the public in his Address that “Vaccination will shed
consolation into the bosom of every family;” but alas! I have
known many a family that has had reason to rue the day in which
they believed him, when he told them this flattering tale....
It is very necessary that his followers pray that the Lord have
mercy on them, if they have no other director than Dr. Walker.</p></div>

<p>Concerning the consequences of Walker’s operations,
Ring, no doubt, testified truly. Many continue to rue
the day when they listen to the flattering tale of the
vaccinator. But the testimony came strangely from a
Jennerite, who was ready to swear that any abatement
of smallpox in London was due to the vaccinations
effected in great part by “that desperate adventurer,”
Walker!</p>

<p>Ring was implacable, the more so, perhaps, as Walker
and his friends were apparently indifferent to his abuse.
He burst forth afresh in the <cite>London Medical Repository</cite>
for 1821, where among much else we find the following&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hanover Street</span>, <em>11th October, 1821</em>.</p>

<p>The mock Royal Jennerian Society is extending its impositions
and depredations. The emissaries of this bastard institution, as
well as the principals, should suffer transportation if there be any
public spirit among us.</p>

<p>I beg leave to add that the present Society is disclaimed by Dr.
Jenner, who cautioned the Emperor of Russia against it when his
Majesty was in London in 1814.</p>

<p>In my <cite>Caution against Vaccine Swindlers and Imposters</cite>,
published in 1816, I related several instances of the ill effects of
Dr. Walker’s practice, and some in which it had proved fatal. It
was partly for his mal-practice, and partly for his mis-conduct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that he was about to be expelled from the Royal Jennerian Society;
and, after his artful and wicked stratagems, was permitted to resign;
yet now he has the arrogance to call himself Director of that
Society, and to issue his venal diplomas in its name. If Dr.
Walker must imitate the universities of St. Andrews and Aberdeen,
let him at least have like them <em>some</em> certificate of qualification.
If he is determined <em>to grow rich by degrees</em>, let him also endeavour
to grow wise and honest.</p></div>

<p>The diplomas which thus moved Ring’s wrath were
imposing documents, certifying that the holder was
authorised to vaccinate, intended to be framed and exhibited
in the shop or parlour. There was a picture of
something like an arch of Waterloo Bridge with London
in the background and the Royal Arms overhead; Jenner
standing on a pier with a dead serpent hanging in limp
folds over his arm, with the inscription, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per omnia littora
vincitur variola</i>; a woman milking a cow with a group
of children around her, drinking milk out of porringers, as
if milk were cowpox; whilst the bed of the Thames was
blocked with the names of the great and good who had
testified in favour of vaccination&mdash;an allegorical style
of representation then much in vogue and considered
impressive.</p>

<p>In order to create prejudice, Ring had much to say of
Walker’s religious and political principles. He was a
Quaker of the Thomas Paine pattern, and like Paine had
associated with the French revolutionists; but whilst
dressing as a Friend, and associating with Friends, he
was too unconformable a personality for their Society,
and was never received into membership. Ring’s imputations
of rapacity and avarice were grossly absurd as
applied to Walker. He cared for nothing beyond support
in his work as vaccinator. It was said he would take a
£5 note, fold it, stick a pin through it, write an address
on the back, and post it. He would rarely vaccinate the
well-to-do. If they came to his office, he would ask,
“Who is thy medical attendant?” and wrapping up some
fresh matter on glasses would say, “Take this with my
compliments to thy medical attendant, and he will do
what is requisite quite as well as myself.” When he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
call at a house to vaccinate, he never asked for a fee, and
his biographer, Dr. Epps,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> observes that he was only
known on one occasion to express a wish for remuneration.
Meeting a merchant in St. Paul’s Churchyard, whose
household he had vaccinated at some inconvenience, he
observed, “Friend, if thou has sent by thy servant a draft
for my services to thy family, he has either robbed me or
deceived thee.” When money was brought to him, he
usually called his wife to receive it, she having the undivided
care of all that pertained to him apart from
vaccination. Of this good woman, Annie, he was in the
habit of speaking with an admiration and unreserve that
constituted one of his numerous oddities. For example,
when Dr. Moore in his <cite>History of Vaccination</cite> observed
somewhat maliciously&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Walker, it is said, procured a medical diploma from the
indulgent University of Leyden; and more excellent work than
Walker’s has rarely been performed by a humbler instrument&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Walker good-humouredly replied, that Moore as a Glasgow
man naturally preferred his own University to that
of Leyden, but he too had cause to love Glasgow&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad4 fs80">“Glasgow is a bonnie town, and there are bonnie lasses in it.”</p>

<p class="noindent">There is not any other spot on the surface of the globe where I
have experienced a happiness so complete as I obtained in it in
1799. Let any bachelor who cannot divine what this assertion
may mean, be informed, that it was then and there I entered into
marriage; and the covenant was ratified in the office of the Clerk
of the Peace for the county of Lanarkshire.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p></div>

<p>Walker was obstinate, but not vindictive. Dr. James
Sims offered him £1000 in 1806 to prosecute his adversaries
for conspiracy, but he left them to their devices,
and proved his quality by outworking and superseding
them. He replied to Moore’s flippant version of the
causes that led to the division and destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Royal Jennerian Society with perfect self-control and
manifest truthfulness, but at the same time with a simplicity
not of this world.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Jenner’s spite, Ring’s abuse,
and the sneers of the superfine did him little harm; and,
if vaccination were beneficial, I should have nothing but
praise for the good people, who, recognising the sincerity
of his work, disregarded trivialities of manner, and supported
him loyally as a faithful servant.</p>

<p>Walker was nothing but a vaccinator. Day after day,
in rain or sunshine, his lank figure, and self-complacent
visage under a white broad-brimmed hat were to be seen
making the round of the vaccine stations. When he
entered a room, he first glanced at the table on which he
expected to find his books. If any mothers had placed
their children’s bonnets or garments thereon, they were
at once swept off. He then ranged the company in order
against the wall like a schoolmaster, and delivered a
short address on the protection he was about to confer.
The children’s names were taken down with a preliminary
caution to speak distinctly. When women muttered
or gabbled, the Doctor grew irritable, and would sometimes
make a troublesome woman spell her infant’s name
half-a-dozen times, adding, “Now thou wilt know how
to speak plainly.” Having got the names, he had next
to look out for virus. The few mothers who had ventured
to return with their vaccinated babes for examination,
would perhaps lose courage and attempt to escape,
when Walker would dart to the door and arrest the
fugitive, saying, “Thou foolish woman! If thou wilt
not do good to others, I will bless thy little one,” and
would proceed to gather what he called his “Vaccine
Roses.” He pursued his operations calmly indifferent to
the screams of the children and the complaints of the
mothers, and as he disposed of each case pronounced the
illusory benediction, “Thy child is safe: fear not: fare
thee well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Walker died in 1830, aged seventy-one, after a short
illness, in which “he refused to take any medicine though
himself a physician.” In the Report of the London Vaccine
Institution for 1831 we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was a man who day after day, month after month, and year
after year, watched with the care of a parent the cause of which he
was so experienced an advocate; who was willing to know nothing
but the object of his early love, Vaccination; who for upwards of a
quarter of a century never omitted one lawful day going his rounds
to the numerous stations of the Institution; and who, it may be
almost said, ended his life with the lancet in his hand, for he went
round to the stations two days before he died.</p></div>

<p>Toward the end of his life, he used to boast that he
had performed upwards of one hundred thousand vaccinations.
So far as vaccination prevailed in London, it
was chiefly through Walker’s exertions; and he was just
the character, being set going, to keep going whatever
the adverse evidence or obloquy. He had his plans and
his methods, and those who tried to modify them took
nothing by their pains. He was a man to have his own
way, and those who did not like him might leave him.
Whether from incapacity or affectation, he made no
attempt at politeness, and said precisely what he thought
without accommodation. He was a piece of mechanism
rather than of genial humanity.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr lsp">JENNER’S LATER WRITINGS.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Jenner’s later writings were chiefly apologies for the
failures of vaccination. His position was one of much
difficulty, and its peculiarity is rarely, if ever, recognised.
For example, how few know that his <cite>Inquiry</cite> published
in 1798, “that master-piece of medical induction,” according
to Mr. John Simon, was kept out of print and
referred to as rarely as possible after 1801-2.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer to the question is so important that at the
risk of repetition I give it explicitly.</p>

<p>The <cite>Inquiry</cite> was suppressed because of its ascription
of cowpox to horsegrease.</p>

<p>It was the belief of dairy-maids in Gloucestershire
that to have had cowpox was to be secure from smallpox.
Jenner was much impressed by the rustic superstition,
and brought it so persistently before his medical brethren
at their convivial assemblies, that they threatened to
expel him if he bored them any longer with the subject.
“It is true,” they said, “that the maids believe an attack
of cowpox keeps off smallpox, but we know they are
wrong; for we are all familiar with cases of smallpox
after cowpox.”</p>

<p>Thus frustrated, Jenner’s ingenuity took another turn.
It was the belief of farriers that if infected in dressing
horses’ greasy heels, they too were secure from smallpox.
The area of this conviction was narrower than that of
the dairy-maids, farriers being neither so numerous, nor
so observant of their beauty: but Jenner entertained
their faith and converted it to his purpose.</p>

<p>Horsegrease protected from smallpox, if cowpox did
not. But might there not be one sort of cowpox that
answered to the dairy-maids’ faith, if another sort did
not? Happy thought! The defensive sort was derived
from the horsegrease which protected the farriers: the
non-defensive originated spontaneously on the cows.
Men, fresh from handling horses’ greasy heels, milked
cows and communicated to them the horses’ disease.
Milkmaids, who in turn contracted from the cows that
sort of pox, were like the farriers secure from smallpox,
yea securer; whilst milkmaids who contracted pox spontaneously
developed on cows were not secure. The
milkmaids’ superstition was therefore justifiable: they
were right and they were wrong&mdash;right when they got
pox through the cow from the horse; wrong when they
got pox from the cow simply.</p>

<p>Why then, it may be asked, did not Jenner dismiss
the cow from consideration? Why did he not base his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
prescription on the farriers’ experience, and use and recommend
horsegrease exclusively for inoculation? The
question is an obvious one, but it is not easy to make
out Jenner’s answer with precision. His assertion was,
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The virus from the horse is not to be relied upon as rendering
the system secure from variolous infection, but the matter produced
by it on the nipple of the cow is perfectly so&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">which was to say that horsegrease attained its highest
prophylaxy after transmission through the cow.</p>

<p>Such was the doctrine of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, “that master-piece
of medical induction.”</p>

<p>When the doctrine came to be reduced to practice,
difficulties arose. Cowpox was considered wholesome
and credible, whilst horsegrease was repulsive and incredible.
Still fact was fact; and many were ready to
accept horsegrease through the cow, or without the cow,
if such indeed were the source of the new salvation.
Cowpox proved to be a rare commodity, whilst horsegrease
was common, and numerous attempts were made
to produce cowpox by means of grease, but ineffectually.
At some attempts, Jenner officiated. Marshall records
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Sewell, Assistant Professor at the Royal Veterinary College,
informs me that he was a witness to a series of experiments, twice
repeated, at the College in the presence of Dr. Jenner, Dr. Woodville,
Mr. Wachsel, and Mr. Turner, with a view to produce the
vaccine disease on the teats of a cow. The matter of grease had
been immediately taken from the horse, and variously applied by
long continued friction, punctures, scarifications, and by scratching
the surface with a needle; but from these trials neither inflammation,
nor any affection resembling a pock resulted.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p></div>

<p>To this discomfiture Jenner had to submit. His ascription
of cowpox to horsegrease was stigmatised as an error
of which the less that was said the better. It is true
that other experimenters were more successful, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Loy of Whitby and Sacco of Milan dispensed with the
cow as a superfluity and used matter direct from the
horse for inoculation, passing the virus from arm to arm
into general circulation until what was equine was lost
sight of and indistinguishable from what was vaccine;
but Jenner did not care to be justified at the risk of his
popularity and the money on which he had set his heart.
He saw how the wind of public favour was blowing, and
went with it. Since horsegrease was disliked, he consented
to its oblivion. Pearson, the chief promoter and
organiser of vaccination, scoffed at horsegrease, and used
spontaneous cowpox, which Jenner knew was of no avail
against smallpox; but he entered no protest upon that
score. On the contrary, he let the futile practice go on;
he claimed it as his own; and he set about manufacturing
excuses for the failures which were imminent.</p>

<p>Spurious cowpox was one of the most dexterous of
these excuses. If injury or smallpox followed vaccination,
the disaster was ascribed to spurious cowpox.
Jenner’s <cite>Further Observations</cite>, published in 1799, was
designed to teach “how to distinguish with accuracy
between that peculiar pustule which is the <em>true</em> Cow
Pock and that which is <em>spurious</em>;” and in his <cite>Origin of
the Vaccine Inoculation</cite> in 1801 even greater stress was
laid on the distinction. By and bye, however, the excuse
worked more harm than advantage. People got terrified
with the mischiefs ascribed to spurious cowpox, and as
which was genuine and which spurious was only discoverable
in their consequences, they began to decline to
have either. It then became expedient to deny spurious
cowpox, which Jenner did. He confessed to the Royal
College of Physicians that there was not a true and a
false cowpox; and that by spurious cowpox he “meant
nothing more than to express irregularity in the form
and progress of the vaccine pustule from which its
efficacy is inferred.”</p>

<p>In view of facts like these, there is little cause for surprise
that the publication of Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> with its
two supplements was not continued. What he set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
as essential was treated as illusory, whilst the cowpox in
which he had taught there was no security had been
brought into use everywhere. Why therefore embarrass
himself with proclamations of his own blunders? The
believers in vaccination were good-natured and incurious,
and he had their homage, which was agreeable and
profitable, and why should he dissipate it? The <cite>Inquiry</cite>
was printed for the third time in 1801, but “this master-piece
of medical induction” has never been republished;
and the probability is, that if ever reproduced, it will be
to prove to the world the emptiness of its author’s pretensions.</p>

<p>Jenner’s original promises of immunity from smallpox
by inoculation with horsegrease cowpox were absolute.
Thus he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The person who has been affected with Cowpox Virus is for ever
after secure from the infection of the Smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>It clearly appears that this disease, Cowpox, leaves the constitution
in a state of perfect security from the infection of the Smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Cowpox admits of being inoculated on the human frame with the
most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with the singularly
beneficial effect of rendering through life the person so inoculated
perfectly secure from the infection of the Smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p></div>

<p>Experience was not slow to demonstrate the futility
of these assurances. At first the facts were flatly denied:
it was impossible for smallpox to succeed cowpox. The
evidence, however, grew too strong to be outsworn, and
then it was said the cowpox must have been spurious.
As failures accumulated over the operations of Jenner
himself and his choice disciples (who were naturally presumed
to know and avoid spurious cowpox) they began
to lay great stress on the fact that smallpox itself did
not always avert a subsequent attack; and if smallpox
did not save from smallpox, why, they demanded, should
cowpox be expected to do more?<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Why, indeed! Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the cases of smallpox after cowpox were as scores to those
of smallpox after smallpox, and then the argument was
reduced to a competition between variolation and vaccination.
“You inoculators with smallpox,” said the
vaccinators, “are continually having smallpox after
variolation, and why should we be expected to be more
successful?” Why, indeed! The inoculators with
smallpox in turn denied that after efficient variolation
smallpox ever occurred, or could possibly occur; and thus
the wrangle went on. One thing was plain and certain&mdash;the
original claim of Jenner for the absolute infallibility
of Horsegrease Cowpox as a preventive of Smallpox
was reduced and surrendered bit by bit until it came
to this at last&mdash;it made Smallpox milder!</p>

<p>These repeated surrenders were, however, never ingenuous.
Mistakes are inevitable, and they are forgiven
when frankly confessed; but frank confession was not
Jenner’s habit. When vaccination failures had become
notorious in 1808, he had the hardihood to assert, that
from the outset he had recognised that as smallpox did
not always avert smallpox, neither did he expect cowpox
to do so; and cited as proof of his prescience this passage
from <cite>Further Observations</cite> in 1799&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It should be remembered that the constitution cannot, by previous
infection, be rendered <em>totally</em> insusceptible of the variolous poison;
neither the casual, nor the inoculated Smallpox, whether it produce
the disease in a mild or violent way, can <em>perfectly</em> extinguish the
susceptibility.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p></div>

<p>Here Jenner made a bold draft on his reader’s ignorance.
It was his claim for horsegrease cowpox that it
conferred an absolute security from smallpox without
any qualification whatever. The assumed prescience in
1799 is completely belied when we refer to his arrogant
manifesto of 1801. These are his words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The scepticism that appeared amongst the most enlightened of
medical men, when my sentiments on Cowpox were first promulgated,
was highly laudable. To have admitted the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of a doctrine, at once so novel <em>and so unlike anything that ever
appeared in the Annals of Medicine</em>, without the test of the most
rigid scrutiny, would have bordered upon temerity; but now,
when the scrutiny has taken place, not only among ourselves, but
in the first professional circles in Europe, and when it has been
uniformly found in such abundant instances, that <em>the human frame,
when once it has felt the influence of the genuine Cowpox</em> in the
way that has been described, <em>is never afterwards</em>, at any period of
its existence, <em>assailable by the Smallpox</em>, may I not with perfect
confidence congratulate my country and society at large on their
beholding, in the mild form of Cowpox, an antidote that is capable
of extirpating from the earth a disease that is every hour devouring
its victims; a disease that has ever been considered as the severest
scourge of the human race!<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p></div>

<p>Cowpox was thus set forth as a prophylactic with
powers hitherto unknown and unique; so that Jenner was
cut off from the claim of its equivalence with smallpox
in character and consequences. He knew in 1799, as
we have seen, that infection with smallpox did not
render the constitution proof against the subsequent
influence of the disease; but in 1801, as we see, it was
his express contention that what smallpox failed to do
<em>that</em> cowpox did&mdash;it protected the constitution perfectly
and for ever from smallpox, and nothing to compare
with it had ever appeared in the Annals of Medicine. It
was only under the pressure of exposure and defeat that
he humbled himself to write to Dunning, 1st March,
1806&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The security given to the constitution by Vaccine Inoculation is
<em>exactly equal</em> to that given by the Variolous. To expect more from
it would be wrong. As failures in the latter are constantly presenting
themselves, we must expect to find them in the former also.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p></div>

<p>To this pass was the infallible preservative from
smallpox, with nothing to match it in the Annals
of Medicine, reduced within the experience of seven
years!</p>

<p>The most thorough-going and far-reaching of Jenner’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
excuses for vaccination failures were herpetic affections
of the skin. In his journal we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inoculated C. F. a second time. It is very evident that the
affection of the skin called red gum deadens the effect of the Vaccine
Virus. This infant was covered with it when inoculated four days
ago. The same happened with Mrs. D.’s infant.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></div>

<p>To Mr. Dunning he wrote from Cheltenham, October
25th, 1804&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How frequently does the Vaccine Disease become entangled with
herpes! I see that the herpetic fluid is one of those morbid poisons
which the human body generates, and when generated, that it may
be perpetuated by contact. Children who feed on trash at this
season of the year are apt to get distended bellies, and on them it
often appears about the lips. This is the most familiar example
that I know. <em>A single vesicle is capable of deranging the action
of the vaccine pustule.</em> Subdue it, and all goes on correctly.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></div>

<p>And again to the same correspondent, 23rd December,
1804&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My opinion is that the chief interference with the success of
Vaccination is herpes in some form or another. I have discovered
that it is a very Proteus, assuming as it thinks fit the character of
the greater part of the irritative eruptions that assail us.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p></div>

<p>Having thus detected an all-sufficient explanation
of the failure of vaccination to prevent smallpox, he
communicated his discovery to the <cite>Medical and Physical
Journal</cite>, August, 1804, in a paper entitled, “On
the Varieties and Modifications of the Vaccine Pustule
occasioned by an Herpetic State of the Skin,” but he
complained to Dunning “that it seemed not to have
excited the slightest interest.” In order to call attention
afresh to the subject, he had the article reprinted as a
pamphlet at Cheltenham in 1806 and at Gloucester in
1819, but in vain. He complained to Baron in 1817
that he could not get the Board of the National Vaccine
Establishment to attend to his cautions touching the interference
of cutaneous diseases with the progress of the
vaccine vesicle. “I am afraid,” he observed, “that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
extreme ignorance of medical men on this subject will
destroy the advantages which the world ought to derive
from the practice.”<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>What of course medical men with the least common
sense perceived was, that the excuse provided for vaccination
failures was too liberal to be worth anything.
If the least cutaneous eruption was sufficient to frustrate
vaccination, what operation could be pronounced efficient?
for it could scarcely be intended that every patient
should be stripped to the skin and minutely examined
for herpetic vesicles. There was nothing transitory
in Jenner’s opinion about herpes: he harped upon its
mischiefs and omnipresence to the close of his life.
William Dillwyn of Walthamstow having asked him
for any observations that occurred to him on the practice
of vaccination for the benefit of Friends in Philadelphia,
Jenner replied in a letter dated Berkeley, 19th August,
1818, in which we find these remarks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I must candidly acknowledge that I am not at all surprised that
a partial prejudice should now and then lift up its head against
Vaccination. It is called into existence, not from anything faulty
in the principle, but from its wrong and injudicious application.
For example, a child, or family of children, may be in such a
state, that the action of the vaccine fluid when applied to the skin
shall be either wholly or partially resisted. It may either produce
no effect at all, or it may produce pustules varying considerably
in their rise, progress and general appearance from those which
have been designated <em>correct</em>. It was about the year 1804 that I
was fortunate enough to discover the general cause of these deviations,
and no sooner was it fully impressed on my mind, than I
published it to the world. Yet few, very few indeed, among those
who vaccinate, have paid any attention to it; yet I am confident,
from the review of the practice on an immense scale, that it is a
matter which has a greater claim on our attention than any one
thing besides connected with Vaccination&mdash;indeed I may say than
any other thing. What I allude to is a coincident eruptive state
of the skin, principally bearing what we call the herpetic or eruptive
character. If we vaccinate a child under its influence, we are apt
to create confusion. The pustule will participate in the character
of the herpetic blotch, and the two thus become blended, forming
an appearance that is neither vaccine nor herpetic; but the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of it is that the patient does not receive that <em>perfect</em> security from
Smallpox infection which is given by the perfect pustule.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p></div>

<p>These complaints of the indifference of the medical
world to his prophesying, show how completely the
business of vaccination had passed out of Jenner’s hands.
The influence of herpes on vaccination, although declared
by him to be of the utmost importance, even to the extent
of imperilling the advantages of the practice, was
disregarded as unworthy of serious attention.</p>

<p>Another of Jenner’s apologetics was a pamphlet in
1808<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> designed to explain away the failure of the variolous
test&mdash;the test that deceived so many in the early
days of vaccination. The inoculated with cowpox were
inoculated with smallpox, and when the smallpox did
not “take,” it was said, “Behold the perfect protection!”
The smallpox inoculators complained bitterly of the
hocus-pocus. “No wonder,” they said, “that when the
system is in a fever with bestial corruption, that human
pox will not ‘take,’ but try after awhile.” And they did
try after awhile, and it was found that the vaccinated
could be inoculated with smallpox like the unvaccinated.
Indeed, when it was seen that the vaccinated fell victims
to smallpox, many who had been vaccinated resorted to
the smallpox inoculators for their supposed superior protection,
and received it without hindrance from their
previous vaccination. It therefore became judicious to
disown the variolous test; but neither in this case was
the surrender frankly made, but with prevarication that
deprived it of all grace. What the smallpox inoculators
maintained, Jenner had to allow, but after this fashion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My principal object is to guard those who may think fit to
inoculate with variolous matter after Vaccination from unnecessary
alarms; a pustule may sometimes be thus excited, as on those who
have previously gone through Smallpox; febrile action in the constitution
may follow; and, as has been exemplified, a slight eruption.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>For the variolous he recommended the substitution of
the vaccine test; saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the commencement of Vaccination, I deemed the Variolous
Test necessary; but I now feel confident that we have one of equal
efficacy, and infinitely less hazardous in the re-insertion of the
vaccine lymph&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Which was to say that vaccination immediately after
vaccination would be found impossible&mdash;the later practice
of periodical re-vaccination being unforeseen.</p>

<p>Jenner might have perceived that after his proclamation
of the influence of herpes on vaccination, there was
nothing to be said for the variolous test. When he consented
to run vaccination on the same terms as variolation,
and admitted that it would be wrong to expect
more from the one practice than from the other, he was
bound in consistency to allow that if vaccination was
frustrated by eruptions of the skin, it was matter of
consequence that variolation should be frustrated by the
fever of vaccination. He informed Dillwyn that he
destroyed cutaneous eruptions by the application of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unguentum hydrargyri nitrati</i>, and then vaccinated
with success. The smallpox inoculators did so likewise.
When the irritation induced by vaccination had had time
to subside, they too variolated with success.</p>

<p>The letter to Dillwyn, 1818, contains some other points
which it is instructive to note. For example, the following
passage proves two things, first, how notorious had
become vaccination failures; and, second, how vaccination,
from an easy art that any one might practise, had
been converted into a mystery to which even “an eminent
surgeon” might be unequal. Jenner says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One word more with respect to prejudice. How frequently
have we seen in the public prints paragraphs of this description&mdash;“A
gentleman’s family, consisting of three or four or half-a-dozen
children, were vaccinated by an eminent surgeon, and all went
through the disease in the most satisfactory manner, and were
pronounced safe; yet, on being exposed to the infection of the
Smallpox, they all had the disease, but happily they all recovered.”
Here, Sir, the mind becomes entangled with a false association.
The public conceive that <em>an eminent surgeon</em> must be a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
master of this little branch of our art; but it often happens that
he has not stooped to look at anything beyond its outline; and
when deviations arise in the progress of the pustules [as from
herpes] to that extent which I have pointed out as momentous,
they are passed by without attracting any particular attention.</p></div>

<p>A report having got abroad that Jenner had renounced
his faith in vaccination, he replied to Dillwyn&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My confidence in the efficacy of Vaccination to guard the constitution
from Smallpox is not in the least diminished. That
exceptions to the rule have appeared, and that they will appear, I
am ready to admit. They have happened after Smallpox Inoculation;
and by the same rule, as the two diseases are so similar,
they will also happen after Vaccine Inoculation.</p></div>

<p>In presence of such a declaration, it is easy to understand
why the <cite>Inquiry</cite> with its supplements was kept
out of print, and never referred to. His confidence in
vaccination not in the least diminished! In the words
cited, he surrendered afresh the claim with which he
started, and for which he was paid, namely, that inoculation
with cowpox rendered the constitution proof against
smallpox for life, and that the protection thus afforded
was without precedent in medical experience.</p>

<p>Having thus, under stress of necessity, reduced vaccination
to the level of variolation, and tried to shelter the
failures of the one practice under those of the other, the
spirit of the old quack surviving, he went on to prophesy
in the familiar strain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a curious and most delightful fact that Smallpox is flying
before Vaccination in all directions. In a wide district around me,
embracing the most populous part of the county of Gloucester,
the Smallpox is scarcely heard of; and if it does happen to appear
from infection brought by the wandering pauper, it either finds
itself insulated, or is rendered incapable of spreading by giving
immediately the vaccine security to those within its atmosphere
who may happen to remain unprotected.</p></div>

<p>With Jenner’s turn for romance, there is no need for
dealing with a statement like the foregoing seriously,
else we might ask what was the prevalence of smallpox
in Gloucestershire before vaccination? and to what extent
had it been cultivated by inoculators? Throughout
England there was a remarkable subsidence of smallpox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
precedent to the introduction of vaccination (for which
vaccination obtained the credit), which subsidence was
no doubt accelerated by the cessation of variolation.
Jenner resumes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wherever Vaccination has been <em>universally</em> practised, there the
Smallpox ceases to exist. It matters not how wide the district, or
how populous the city, the result is, and, from the nature of things,
must be the same. There is scarcely a part of the civilised world
that cannot bear testimony to the truth of this position. For extent
of territory, we may turn our eyes to our possessions in the East,
and to various parts of South America; and to towns and cities,
many of the most conspicuous in Europe.</p>

<p>In the island of Ceylon, the ravages of Smallpox were dreadful,
although many efforts had been made to lessen its fatality by
Variolous Inoculation. This, wherever it was practised, produced
a spreading of the disease, and made a bad matter worse; so that
the people would have nothing to do with it. But after a little
time they took to Vaccine Inoculation very readily, and Smallpox
became totally extinct.</p>

<p>From Sweden, too, we have a report that proves the extinction
of Smallpox throughout the kingdom. Now as the good sense of
the Swedes brought about this happy event, why should not
Britain avail herself of the great gift, and employ it to the same
effect? Here the Boon is distributed with a partial and a sparing
hand, and consequently Smallpox still exists in several parts of
our island.</p></div>

<p>There was no checking Jenner when he rose into
rhodomontade about the myriads of Asia and the vastness
of America, but descending to the definite in Ceylon
and Sweden we can test him with precision, and as to
both we shall find his statements at wide variance with
facts. For the present, however, let us keep to our own
country, and note especially what he had to assert of
London in 1818&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nevertheless I have the happiness to say, that since the first
promulgation of my discovery in 1798, the deaths of Smallpox in
the British Realms, according to the best estimates I can form, are
reduced from more than 40,000 to less than 6,000 annually. The
metropolis for the last ten or twelve years exhibited a reduction of
about one half only; but during the last two years, Vaccination
has been more extensively practised than ever, both from the
benevolence of private individuals and the faculty, and by public
institutions; and this year, 1818, promises a far greater reduction
in the number of deaths than any that has preceded it.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>In London in 1818 the deaths from smallpox were low
(421); but a single year is of little account, and must be
viewed in relation to preceding years. Here we have a
statement for the decade, 1811-20, taken from the metropolitan
Bills of Mortality.</p>

<p>From this statement we see that the decrease in London
smallpox that set in toward the close of the 18th
Century was maintained; but that vaccination had aught
to do with the decrease there is no reason to believe&mdash;unless
in so far as the new practice discouraged variolation.
How, we ask, could the vaccination of one-tenth
of the Londoners (if so many) reduce the smallpox among
nine-tenths? We have also to observe that mortality
from fevers abated in common with smallpox; and it
cannot be pretended that that abatement was also due to
vaccination! The rational assumption is, that what
diminished fevers in London, likewise diminished smallpox.
Nor should we overlook the fact, that as the
deaths from smallpox declined, those from measles increased;
nor the probability that many deaths formerly
ascribed to smallpox were derived from measles, and that
part of the decline in one column is accounted for by the
increase in the other.</p>

<p>Jenner’s assertion, that the national mortality from
smallpox had been reduced from more than 40,000 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
less than 6000 annually, had no basis whatever in
reality. As we know, the 40,000 deaths were got by
multiplying the deaths of a bad year of London smallpox
by the population of the United Kingdom&mdash;as if
London were the standard of England, Ireland, and
Scotland! How he obtained the reduced number of 6000
we are left to conjecture. In reviewing Jenner’s writings
we are startled with his inconsistencies, and scarcely less
with the carelessness and credulity of his adherents.
He set out with the common knowledge that cowpox did
<em>not</em> prevent smallpox, and for that reason he substituted
pox generated by horsegrease on the cow. Horsegrease
cowpox could not, however, be procured on demand; and
was, moreover, disliked on the score of its origin; and
cowpox was resorted to by Pearson and Woodville, and
diffused everywhere with acclamation; and Jenner did
not only not object, but took credit, and actually was
allowed to take credit for the pox he had described as
ineffective for the purpose designed! By and bye cowpox
from horsegrease, or horsepox, according to the original
recipe, was obtained and brought into circulation with
Jenner’s sympathy, if without his open approval&mdash;he discerning
that praise and pay were not to be had from that
notion. After a while, horsegrease, or horsepox, was
used for inoculation without the intervention of the cow;
and that too entered into currency as vaccine, Jenner
himself employing and distributing it, although according
to his <cite>Inquiry</cite> it was not to be trusted to prevent
smallpox.</p>

<p>I repeat these facts, even at the risk of tedium, because
it is essential to have them clearly apprehended. For at
least three descriptions of virus Jenner stood responsible,
namely&mdash;</p>

<p>I.&mdash;Horsegrease Cowpox&mdash;the virus warranted in his
<cite>Inquiry</cite>.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;Cowpox, known by Jenner to be ineffective in
preventing smallpox, but favoured by the medical profession
and the public.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Horsegrease (said to have been horsepox), also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
described by Jenner as ineffective, but latterly used and
diffused by him.</p>

<p>To which of these did he attribute the success claimed
for vaccination? Apparently to all indifferently; but if
one were as good as the others, why did he not say so,
and proceed to explain how it was that cowpox did not
save the Gloucestershire milk-maids, nor horsegrease the
farriers from smallpox? Was it that the power to put
such questions, and to answer them, does not consist with
the quack’s intelligence; and that in his lucre he rests
content? Observe, too, how when credit was to be had
for London vaccination, Jenner took it, though at mortal
enmity with the chief agent in the work, repudiating
Walker’s practice as subversive of principles he considered
essential to success.</p>

<p>Jenner’s final publication in 1822 had nothing to do
with vaccination, but was a bid for fame in a new direction.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
It was an attempt to originate a new method of
cure by irritating the skin with tartarated antimony.
He had dabbled with the chemical when a young man,
and John Hunter had suggested that his preparation
should be sold and puffed as Jenner’s Tartar Emetic. In
his last years he returned to it, and produced a series of
cases to prove how many diseases might be alleviated and
removed by using it as a counter-irritant&mdash;just as in the
<cite>Inquiry</cite> he recommended cowpox inoculation with the
same intention. The matter does not concern us further
than to observe that the vesicles and scars produced by
tartarated antimony are almost indistinguishable from
those of vaccination; and that Hufeland, the German
Nestor of Medicine, taught and proved that tartar emetic
was every whit as effective against smallpox as cowpox&mdash;an
opinion from which I see no reason to dissent.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr lsp">BARON’S LIFE OF JENNER.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">We owe much to Baron’s Life of Jenner, but as a collection
of evidence rather than as an organic biography.
It is verbose and loosely put together, and would never
be read unless by some one in quest of information, or
with nothing better to do. Fortunately Baron was
reverent and not critical. Jenner was to him a sacred
being, admirable in all relations, whose only contention
was with “the blindness and wickedness of his traducers.”
Lives written in this temper are often most
instructive. Tales are told and letters produced in pious
simplicity that biographers of the judicious order discreetly
suppress.</p>

<p>Baron made Jenner’s acquaintance in the summer of
1808 when he was living at Fladong’s Hotel, Oxford
Street, revelling in a fool’s paradise as to his importance
in the formation of the National Vaccine Establishment.
Baron had recently come from Edinburgh, and says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was about to commence practice: all the world was before
me. In seeking the acquaintance of Jenner I was impelled mainly
by a desire to do homage to a man whose public and private character
had already secured my warmest admiration. I little thought
that it would so speedily lead to an intimacy, and ultimately to a
friendship, which terminated only at his death, and placed me in
a relationship to his memory that no one could have anticipated.
The greatness of his fame, his exalted talents, and the honours
heaped upon him by all the most distinguished public bodies of
the civilised world, while they made me desirous of offering my
tribute of respect to him, forbade the expectation of more than such
an acknowledgment as a youth, circumstanced as I was, might
have expected. I soon, however, perceived that I had to do with
an individual who did not square his manners by the cold formality
of the world. He condescended as to an equal; the restraint and
embarrassment that might naturally have been felt in the presence
of one so eminent vanished in an instant. The simple dignity of
his aspect, the kind and familiar tone of his language, and the
perfect sincerity and good faith manifested in all he said and did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
could not fail to win the heart of anyone not insensible to such
qualities. Though more than twenty years have elapsed since this
interview took place, I remember it, and all its accompaniments,
with the most perfect accuracy. He was dressed in a blue coat,
white waistcoat, nankeen breeches, and white stockings. All the
tables in his apartment were covered with letters and papers on
the subject of vaccination, and the establishment of the National
Vaccine Institution. He talked to me of the excellent article
which had lately appeared in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, relative to
the vaccine controversy. He spoke with great good humour also
of the conduct of the anti-vaccinists, and gave me some pamphlets
illustrative of the controversy then going on. The day before he
had had an interview with the Princess of Wales, and he showed
me a watch which her Royal Highness had presented to him on
that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p></div>

<p>The passage is a long one, but it has some value in
itself, and exhibits Baron’s habitual attitude toward his
hero. In his private relations, Jenner was amiable,
but it is with his public life that we are concerned, and
find so reprehensible. Mischievous leaders and teachers
are frequently distinguished by private graces; and
austere personal virtue is frequently associated with
bland indifference to conventional immoralities; and we
need not go far to discover counterparts of Jenner in
ordinary life. Nothing is commoner <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'than sauvity'">than suavity</ins> combined
with self-love that is malignant and mendacious
when thwarted. All is pleasant as long as admiration
prevails, but with dissent or resistance the sunny temper
vanishes, and clouds of contempt and fury overspread
the spiritual sky. A sharp test of character is a man’s
disposition to his adversaries; and Jenner was never
magnanimous. His conduct to Pearson, Woodville, and
Walker has been sufficiently described; and similar
jealousy and spitefulness were displayed to whoever
dared to impugn his infallibility in the prevention of
smallpox. No one, for instance, could have brought
forward the fact that smallpox occasionally succeeded
vaccination with more simple good faith than Goldson;
yet Jenner wrote of him with insufferable insolence&mdash;an
insolence that is thrown into stronger relief by the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
that what Goldson testified is accepted at this day,
even by vaccinators, as indisputable matter-of-course.
His bully, too, John Ring, attacked Goldson, and Jenner,
in writing to Dunning, 23rd December, 1804, thus excused
his brutality&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You speak of Ring and Goldson. Recollect there was not time
to be cool. What lover of Vaccination&mdash;what man, well acquainted
with its nature, and that of Smallpox, could read Goldson’s book,
and lay it down coolly? Ring, the moment he read it, and what
indeed was infinitely worse than the book itself, its murderous
harbinger&mdash;the advertisement, instantly charged his blunderbuss,
and fired it in the face of the author. I must freely confess, I do
not feel so cool about this Mr. Goldson as you do. His book has
sent many a victim to a premature grave; and would have sent
many more, but for the humanity and zeal of yourself and others
who stepped forward to counteract its dreadful tendency.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p></div>

<p>In the same spirit he wrote to Baron, 6th November,
1810, of Brown of Musselburgh, who had reported certain
cases of smallpox after vaccination in a London
newspaper&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some notice must be taken of Mr. Brown’s communication; but
if he thinks he shall be able to draw me into controversy, he will
be mistaken. His letter, under the veil of candour and liberality,
is full of fraud and artifice; for he knows that every insinuation
and argument he has advanced, have been refuted by the first
medical characters in Edinburgh and Dublin. But the mild,
gentle, complaisant antagonist, is a character more difficult to deal
with than one who boldly shows his ferocity.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p></div>

<p>As applied to Brown, sagacious and sincere, this was
the very ecstasy of abuse. Even Brown’s adversaries
within his own neighbourhood, ultimately yielded to his
contention. In the <cite>Edinburgh Medical and Surgical
Journal</cite> of July, 1818, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Before we conclude, we must in justice to ourselves pay the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amende honorable</i> to Mr. Brown of Musselburgh, whose opinions
we strenuously controverted in 1809; and to which we now, in
1818, confess ourselves partly converts in consequence of increased
experience and observation.</p></div>

<p>In short, calm discussion of vaccination with Jenner
was never possible. Inquiry was borne down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
clamour, and scepticism denounced as malevolence. “He
could not altogether escape,” says Baron, “from the annoyance
occasioned by <em>the blindness and wickedness</em> of
his traducers”<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>&mdash;and all were traducers who were not
believers. Indeed, Baron could only account for the
perversity of those who did not recognise Jenner as the
saviour of mankind from smallpox by a resort to the
doctrine of inbred depravity, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are compelled to believe that there is a principle in our
nature which has too strong an affinity for what is untrue to permit
the understanding to discern or acknowledge an opposite
principle till both the moral and intellectual vision has been
purified and strengthened.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p></div>

<p class="noindent">Purified and strengthened, and the affinity with falsehood
dissolved, it became possible for the understanding
to appreciate the virtue of cowpox and the veracity of
its advertiser!</p>

<p>Jenner, it may be said, instinctively resented investigation.
He was uneasy in conscious duplicity. He
knew there was no safety in vaccination as practised;
for the cowpox employed was not the horsegrease cowpox
he had commended as efficacious. What he had
prescribed was disregarded; what he had condemned
was approved; but, strange to say, he was praised and
rewarded by the world as if cowpox had been his specific!
Jenner accepted the situation, and possibly came to believe
(after a fashion) that he was enjoying no more than
his own; but under the circumstances it was not surprising
that he shrank from criticism, kept his early
publications out of the way, and resorted to scolding
and shrieking whenever scrutiny appeared imminent.</p>

<p>Worse even than his behaviour to investigators and
opponents was his treatment of those who converted
vaccination to practice. The <cite>Inquiry</cite> was no handbook,
and Pearson, Woodville, and other early vaccinators, had
to make their own way, not only unassisted, but with
Jenner ready to appropriate their successes and to reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
them with their failures. Baron avers that
nothing in the art of vaccination was due to any one
but Jenner himself, qualifying this praise with a slight
exception in favour of Dr. Bryce of Edinburgh, who
made the discovery that if a subject under vaccination
is re-vaccinated, the subsequent inoculation is caught up
and brought to maturity with the precedent&mdash;a phenomenon
that as Bryce’s Test was used to ascertain whether
true vaccine fever was operative. But even Bryce received
scant acknowledgment, and Baron tries to make
out that Jenner was possessed of the fact ere it was
announced.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Jenner’s meanness toward those who displayed
any intelligent independence in co-operation with
him is written at large in Baron’s biography, but with
such innocence that it would be absurd to describe it as
indecent. His good faith is perfect, and it is only a
critical reader that finds out how he is identified with
Jenner, seeing merit nowhere save in his abject servitors
and feminine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">claque</i>.</p>

<p>Vaccinators at this day allow that the influence of
vaccination wears out and ought to be renewed; yet
Jenner would not listen for a moment to such a modification
of its perpetual prophylaxy. Baron writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The year 1804, in Jenner’s estimation, formed an era in the
history of the Variolæ Vaccinæ. The assertion, that the Cowpox
afforded only a temporary security was then insisted on. Had it
been correct, it would have deprived the discovery of nearly all its
value. This assertion was very easily made; and in the infancy
of the practice could not be well disproved. To these circumstances
it was owing, that the crude and unsupported statements of Mr.
Goldson acquired any influence. Dr. Jenner himself, from the
commencement, perceived that in his cases of failure, Cowpox had
never been properly taken.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p></div>

<p>When in 1813 Lord Boringdon introduced his bill to
Parliament for the restriction of variolation, Lord Ellenborough
observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No doubt Vaccination is of some use, but if the noble lord considers
it a complete preventive of Smallpox, I differ from him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
opinion. At the same time, I have proved my respect for the
discovery by having my eight children vaccinated. I believe in
the efficacy of Vaccination to a certain extent. It may prevent
the disorder for eight or nine years; and in a large city like this
with a large family of children, even this limited protection is
desirable.</p></div>

<p>In this declaration the Chief Justice was not singular,
but expressed the general conviction of the public who
held by vaccination in spite of the manifest failure of
the early promises made for it. Nevertheless Jenner
was extremely annoyed: it was to him as the formal
deliverance of judgment. Baron says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have seldom seen Jenner more disturbed than he was by this
occurrence; not certainly because he had any fears that the unsupported
assertion of his lordship would prove correct, but because
it unhappily accorded with popular prejudices, and when uttered
by such a person, in such an assembly, was calculated to do
unspeakable mischief by unsettling the confidence of numberless
anxious parents, and by attempting to deprive Vaccination of more
than half its virtue.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></div>

<p>Thorough was Baron in his defence of Jenner: no
inconsistency appalled him. He records in capitals (as
produced) the following as Jenner’s solemn and final
testimony, written, a few days before he expired, on the
back of a letter, bearing the post-mark, 14th January,
1823&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My opinion of vaccination is precisely as it was when i
first promulgated the discovery. It is not in the least
strengthened by any event that has happened, for it could
gain no strength; it is not in the least weakened, for if the
failures you speak of had not happened, the truth of my
assertions respecting those coincidences which occasioned
them would not have been made out.</span><a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p></div>

<p>Self-deception after this pattern is far from uncommon,
and is proof against evidence and death itself; but Jenner
was not quite so crazy as his words imply. From his
first opinion about vaccination, and its absolute efficacy
against smallpox (unlike anything hitherto known in
medical experience) he had retreated considerably. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
so early as 1804 he had reduced his claim for vaccination
to equality with variolation. In that year he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What I have said on Vaccination is true. If properly conducted,
it secures the constitution as much as Variolous Inoculation
possibly can. It is the Smallpox in a purer form than that which
has been current among us for twelve centuries past.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></div>

<p>And again Baron cites him as saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Duly and efficiently performed, Vaccination will protect the
constitution from subsequent attacks of Smallpox, as much as that
disease itself will. <em>I never expected that it would do more</em>, and it
will not, I believe, do less.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner presumed freely on the forgetfulness of those
he addressed. In a document so well known as his
petition to the House of Commons in 1802, he expressly
claimed that a person inoculated with cowpox was
thereby “rendered perfectly secure from the infection of
smallpox through life”; nor would the furore which
attended the introduction of the practice have been
possible had it been set forth as no more than a milder
form of variolation. That cowpox was equivalent to
smallpox for inoculation was laughed at by the variolators;
but that a vaccinated person was as safe from
smallpox as one who had passed through the disease,
was true in no other sense than that Jenner wished it to
be true, and prophesied accordingly. It was by such
contrivances that he broke his own fall, and alleviated
the disenchantment of the credulous.</p>

<p>Oddly enough Jenner’s fiction, that vaccination was
as good against smallpox as smallpox itself, was revived
in the innocence of ignorance by Sir William Gull before
a committee of the House of Commons in 1871. “Vaccination
is as protective against smallpox as smallpox
itself,” said the fashionable physician. Confutation was,
however, at hand. Mr. Marson (for thirty-five years
resident surgeon of the Highgate Smallpox Hospital)
attested that cases of smallpox after smallpox were comparatively
rare&mdash;not 1 per cent.; whilst 84 per cent. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
those admitted to the Hospital in 1864 were vaccinated.
An instructive contrast between the logic of fancy and
matter of fact!</p>

<p>Baron, with unscrupulous disregard of evidence, complains
that vaccination should ever have been represented
as an infallible preventive of smallpox; so that as pointed
out in the Report of the Royal College of Physicians in
1807, “the fate of the new practice was made to hang
on the occurrence of a single case of smallpox”; and goes
on to observe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This, I am sorry to say, was a great misapprehension; the
opposers of Vaccination endeavoured to place the fate of Vaccination
on such an issue; but if Jenner’s principles be duly considered,
he never at any time sanctioned such an idea; and long before the
practice of Vaccination became general, he anticipated failures,
and explained the circumstances under which they were most
likely to occur.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p></div>

<p>The summary answer to this statement is, that it is
untrue. Jenner anticipated no failures. On the contrary,
he vehemently denied them; and when denial
could no longer avail, he invented a variety of excuses,
such as spurious cowpox and omnipresent herpes, to
account for their occurrence; though always ready (as
we have seen) to hark back to his original assertion that
vaccination was “an infallible preventive of smallpox.”
Baron did not like the word “infallibility.” He writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am not sure that the expression was ever used by Dr. Jenner
himself. If he did use it, he certainly very soon accompanied it
with the necessary qualification. He may perhaps at the outset
have stated his opinion somewhat too decidedly; but no one qualified
to judge can doubt that from the very beginning he was
possessed of the gauge by which to measure the virtues of Vaccination.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p></div>

<p>Whether he did make use of the word “infallible” is
of slight importance. There are various modes in which
the same meaning may be conveyed, and Jenner’s was
unequivocal. It was in 1801 that appealing to the
rigid scrutiny that had taken place in the first professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
circles of Europe, he deliberately proclaimed it as
certain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of
the genuine Cowpox in the way that has been described, is never
afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by the
Smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p></div>

<p>When Lord Ellenborough in 1813 described vaccination
as affording no more than a temporary security
from smallpox, he merely expressed the diminished confidence
of the community in the practice; but it is the
habit of adventurers to ascribe adverse manifestations of
public feeling to petty causes; and thus Jenner held that
the Chief Justice was indulging a personal grudge when
he threw doubt on the perpetual efficacy of his prescription.
On one occasion, so ran the story, Ellenborough
was relating in a company at St. James’s how Jenner
had so little faith in cowpox that he had used smallpox
to inoculate his own child, when he was suddenly confronted
by an irate personage, who exclaimed, “I am
Dr. Jenner, and what you have stated is not true!”
whereupon Ellenborough slunk aside in confusion. The
fact of the rencontre in the sensational form, we may
credit as we please; but about the variolation of Jenner’s
child there is no doubt whatever. We have the circumstance
recorded by himself with such explanation as he
considered adequate.</p>

<p>Turning to the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, we find under Case XXII.
that Robert F. Jenner, aged eleven months, was vaccinated
on 12th April, 1798, and that he did not receive
the infection. The operation was not repeated, and he
remained unvaccinated. Some time afterwards, whilst
Jenner was residing at Cheltenham, Mr. Cother, a surgeon,
happened to drop in, and having taken the child in
his arms, mentioned in the course of conversation, that
he had just left a family suffering from smallpox. “Sir,”
cried Jenner, “you know not what you are doing! That
child is not protected.” What was to be done? “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
was no doubt on my mind,” says Jenner, “that the boy
was infected;” and having none of the precious horsegrease
cowpox in his possession, he held that he was
without alternative, and by Mr. Cother the lad was
immediately inoculated with smallpox.</p>

<p>The fact in due course got abroad, and, as Baron
relates, was made the most of by the opponents of vaccination&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One observed, “Dr. Jenner may say what he likes about Vaccination,
but we know for certain that he has inoculated his own
son with Smallpox.” Another repeated this statement with the
addition, that he had done so because he mistrusted Vaccination.
A third added another tint to deepen the colouring, affirming that
he knew that Dr. Jenner had abandoned his confidence in Vaccination,
and the proof is incontestable, as he has inoculated his own
child with Smallpox. These stories passed from mouth to mouth,
and afterwards appeared in print with every malignant interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p></div>

<p>Such talk was very natural, nor was it without justification.
Jenner ought to have proved his sincerity by
the vaccination of his son; and he who denounced
variolation and variolators with such bitterness might
have accepted the risk of infection from Mr. Cother
rather than have compromised himself so injuriously.
Moreover (as was asked at the time) if the child was infected,
what was the use of inoculation? Variolation
and vaccination (it was argued) may be serviceable in
keeping off smallpox, but are of no avail after infection.</p>

<p>Vaccination has been described as a remarkable survival
of superstition in hygiene&mdash;many, who disowning
all other dodges for the maintenance of health, holding
by it. Of course Jenner knew nothing of hygiene in the
scientific sense&mdash;it was revealed after his time; but it is
noteworthy that in none of his publications or letters is
there any anticipation of the truth that has proved so
fruitful in our experience, namely, that ill-health indicates
ill-living, and that the misery of disease is only
remediable in so far as we come out of the conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
disease. Whilst of such truth he knew nothing, he might
have known something. It lay plainly before him that
smallpox was an affliction of the poor, and of the prosperous
in so far as they shared the conditions of the
poor, but he never recognised the fact. On the contrary,
he cherished the fantasy that various diseases were
derived from association with animals; and that thus
smallpox originated in cowpox, which in turn came from
horsegrease. “There,” said he to his nephew, pointing
to a horse with greasy heels, “there is the source of
smallpox.”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> To entertain such an opinion was to be
stone-blind to the true causes of disease, and therefore
we have no reason for surprise that the Jenner household
lived in chronic ill-health, piously submissive to what
they supposed the divine will. Typhus fever was recurrent
in the household without a suspicion that anything
was amiss on the human side. There was a genius
named Dawes Worgan, whom Jenner received into his
family as tutor to his son, but ere a year had elapsed the
poor fellow had two attacks of typhus, and finally succumbed
to pulmonary consumption in 1809, in his nineteenth
year. Chantry Cottage, Jenner’s residence at
Berkeley, was no temple of Hygeia: on the contrary,
such a place at this day would be a terror to a respectable
neighbourhood, and subject to the attention of the sanitary
inspector.</p>

<p>The principle of vaccination conceded&mdash;that health
may be purchased by disease, it was not surprising that
it was thought that measles and scarlet fever could be
extirpated by similar treatment. Sir Humphry Davy
suggested that hydrophobia might be anticipated by the
inoculation of another animal virus, but Jenner held that
cowpox should be tried&mdash;“nothing like leather.” It was
reported from Constantinople that the plague itself was
stayed by vaccination, and that experiments, exactly
like those used to demonstrate its power against smallpox,
had been repeated with complete success. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
was not, however, enterprise in the East for the development
of the quackery.</p>

<p>Jenner taught that distemper in dogs was preventible
by vaccination, and accumulated a variety of “first-rate
evidence” in proof. It was no transitory whim. He
vaccinated twenty of the King’s staghounds in 1801, and
in 1809 contributed a paper to the Medico-Chirurgical
Society on the subject, wherein he expressed the opinion
that the disease had only existed in England for the
past half century. Several great fox hunters had their
hounds vaccinated, and the results were pronounced
satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Why, then, was the practice not continued?
Why is not distemper exterminated? May we
not say the reason is plain? The first-rate evidence was
illusory. Men are apt to create the facts they wish for,
but as desire subsides, they recover their normal eyesight.
Cowpox, we are persuaded, was as good against
distemper in dogs as against smallpox in human beings,
and but for extraneous causes, it would have been
abandoned for the one as for the other.</p>

<p>For Jenner it has to be said, that if deceived, he had
much to excuse his self-deception. There are men
possessed of convictions which they maintain in the face
of an indifferent or antagonistic world, but Jenner was
not such a man. If his <cite>Inquiry</cite> had gone the way of
waste-paper, he would have offered no resistance; but
instead, it was proclaimed by Pearson as worthy of
universal attention, and the hour being propitious, the
middle-aged country doctor suddenly found himself
treated as the deliverer of mankind from smallpox,
whilst Pearson, his promoter, was swept aside as a half-hearted
worshipper of the new divinity. Adulation was
administered without measure, and if Jenner took it for
true, and was led to imagine that he had more in him
than he ever imagined, what marvel! He became the
centre of a European craze of a character and intensity
that is perhaps without parallel. Emperors and kings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
statesmen and philanthropists, men of science, and in
short the whole educated world conspired to do him
reverence. The craze gradually abated, and the abatement
was most decided in the country of its origin, and
chiefly in London where cowpox and its advertiser were
most closely scrutinised. Jenner abhorred London.
There he had proposed to flourish as a West-End physician,
and there he had encountered a dismal failure.
There, too, his antagonists were active, and their demonstration
of the futility of his assertions most conclusive.
We see his temper toward London in such a passage as
the following from a letter to Dunning, dated Cheltenham,
21st February, 1806&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What havoc the Anti-Vaccinists have made in town by the re-introduction
of Variolous Inoculation! It is computed that not
less than 6000 persons in the metropolis, and the adjacent villages,
have fallen victims to the Smallpox since April last. One would
scarcely conceive it possible, but these murders are, for the most
part, to be attributed to the absurd productions of Moseley, Rowley,
and that pert little Squirrel, to say nothing of Goldson. It is about
London that the venom of these deadly serpents chiefly flows.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p></div>

<p>Whilst the doors of almost every scientific corporation
in the world were thrown open to receive him, the Royal
College of Physicians of London maintained an honourable
reserve; and when in 1814 his claim to admission
was strongly urged, the majority insisted that, if received,
he should submit to the usual examination&mdash;a sufficient
check in Jenner’s case.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The College has been reproached
for its treatment of “the immortal benefactor of the
human race,” but it is forgotten how intimately the
leading members were acquainted with his immortality,
and with what disgust they must have received his
confession in 1807 as to the non-existence of spurious
cowpox.</p>

<p>Toward the close of his life, Jenner rarely appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
London. His last visit took place in 1814, when he was
presented to the Emperor of Russia. “I am happy to
think,” said Alexander, “that you have received the
thanks, the applause, and the gratitude of the world;”
to which Jenner made answer, “I have received the
thanks and the applause, but <em>not</em> the gratitude of the
world”&mdash;the absent gratitude being a periphrase for
absent cash, and a hint to the Czar that he might repeat
the superb munificence of his grandmother, Catharine, to
her inoculator Dimsdale. The Emperor, however, gave
nothing, and Jenner retired keenly disappointed. Whatever
the imperial disposition, Jenner did little to render
it more propitious by using his audience to denounce
Walker and the Friends by whom vaccination was at
that time chiefly promoted; for as Alexander said, “I
love the good Quakers: they are my friends, indeed;”
and whoever slandered them was not likely to advance
in his favour.</p>

<p>With all he got Jenner reckoned himself ill-paid; and
taking the words of his admirers for sincere, he was ill-paid.
Many a successful slayer of his kind had much
more from the House of Commons with less fuss than
their ideal preserver; but there is often a measure of
sincerity within insincerity, and many of those who
praised Jenner most rapturously felt that he had not
been dealt with illiberally as the advertiser of cowpox.</p>

<p>Jenner’s wife died in 1815, an ailing, pious, affectionate
woman, and thenceforth he dwelt in retirement until his
death on the 26th of January, 1823, at the age of seventy-four.
“Never,” he wrote to his friend Gardner on 13th
January, a week before his demise, “Never was I involved
in so many perplexities.” Hailed with acclamation in
1800-2 as the saviour of mankind from smallpox, during
the remaining twenty years of his life he underwent a
steady course of discredit as failure after failure was
recorded and attested against vaccination. Appropriate
therefore was his farewell to the world in 1823, “Never
was I involved in so many perplexities.” There was not
enthusiasm left to effect the interment of his remains in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey, and the funeral took place at
Berkeley. An attempt was made to obtain a grant from
Parliament for a monument, but the proposal fell flat.
Baron then set on foot a subscription for the purpose,
but it met with little encouragement. The only public
bodies which contributed anything were the Edinburgh
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, the first sending
£50 and the second £10. With much difficulty sufficient
was scraped together to order a statue from Sievier, which
was set up at the west end of the nave of Gloucester
Cathedral. The front panel of the pedestal originally
bore the dates of birth and death, but Baron had them
removed, considering the word <span class="smcap">Jenner</span> all significant.</p>

<p>In latter times, in 1859, a statue was erected to his
memory in Trafalgar Square, London, close by the College
of Physicians, but it was felt to have an air of possible
quackery about it, and by and bye was quietly removed
to a corner in Kensington Gardens. There is, as I have
remarked, a measure of sincerity even in insincerity; and
it is impossible for any one with a lively sense of veracity
to <em>know</em> Edward Jenner and entertain for him any
respect.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE MEDICAL POSITION IN 1823.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">When Jenner died in 1823, the judgment of the majority
of the people was pronounced against cowpox inoculation;
but medical men, who are expected to <em>know</em> something,
and <em>do</em> something, against every ailment, rarely surrender
a prescription until it can be replaced by another. The
doctors therefore held by vaccination, but on modified
terms; and the position to which they had been reduced
is set forth in an article in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, for
November, 1822, concerning which Jenner wrote to Gardner,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '13th February, 1823'">13th January, 1823</ins>, a week before his death&mdash;</p>

<p>I have an attack from a quarter I did not expect, the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>. These people understand literature better than physic.
It will do incalculable mischief. I put it down at 100,000 deaths
at least. Never was I involved in so many perplexities.</p></div>

<p>What an extraordinary article! working mischief incalculable,

<p>If, however, Jenner was right, it will be allowed, I think,
that the murder of a poet was exceeded in atrocity by the
slaughter of at least one hundred thousand ordinary mortals.
Wherefore, to discover the manner of the great
iniquity, I looked up the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> and discovered
the diabolical article. It is entitled “Vaccination
and Smallpox”; is obviously written by the editor, Jeffrey;
and the rock of offence was at once apparent. Doubt is
thrown on the efficacy of vaccination to prevent smallpox;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, vaccination thus discredited will be neglected; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>,
vaccination thus neglected will enlarge the domain of
smallpox; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, at least one hundred thousand persons
will perish. Q.E.D. But it will be asked, “What did
Jeffrey say?” The article thus opens&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vaccination, we are perfectly persuaded, is a very great blessing
to mankind; but not quite so great a blessing, nor so complete a
protection, as its early defenders conceived it to be. The proof of
this has been admitted with great reluctance; but it has unfortunately
become too strong for denial or resistance. The first answers
given to the instances of failure, with which the friends of Vaccination
were pressed, were, either that the disease which had occurred
after Vaccination was Chickenpox, and not Smallpox; or that the
process of Vaccination had been unskilfully or imperfectly conducted;
or that it was one of those very rare cases which occurred
in the times of Inoculation, and from which Vaccination itself did
not pretend to be wholly exempt.</p></div>

<p>The Report of the Vaccine Pock Institution for 1803
is cited, as follows, to show how absolute was the confidence
in vaccination in the days of inexperience&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have been alarmed two or three times with intelligence of
Smallpox occurring several weeks or months after our patients had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
undergone the Cowpox. We thought it our duty to visit and
examine these patients, and also to inquire into their history among
their attendants, and by these means we obtained the completest
satisfaction that the pretended Smallpox was generally the Chickenpox.</p></div>

<p>As time went on, cases of smallpox after vaccination
kept multiplying, and the various excuses to account for
their occurrence, though obstinately asserted, utterly
broke down. There remained no doubt whatever that
to be vaccinated in the most approved fashion afforded
no guarantee against smallpox. In 1820, said Jeffrey,
the Board of the National Vaccine Establishment was
compelled to make the following melancholy admission&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is true that we have received accounts from different parts
of the country of numerous cases of Smallpox having occurred after
Vaccination; and we cannot doubt that the prejudices of the people
against this preventive expedient are assignable (and not altogether
unreasonably perhaps) to this cause. These cases the Board has
been industriously employed in investigating; and though it appears
that many of them rest only on hearsay evidence, and that
others seem to have undergone the Vaccine Process imperfectly
some years since when it was less well understood, and practised less
skilfully than it ought to be; yet, after every reasonable deduction,
we are compelled to allow that too many still remain on undeniable
proof, to leave any doubt that the pretensions of Vaccination
to the merit of a perfect and exclusive security in all cases
against Smallpox, were admitted at first too unreservedly.</p></div>

<p>The significance of a confession like the foregoing is
not to be estimated literally. It was exacted under irresistible
pressure of facts, numerous, definite and undeniable,
after every method of excuse and prevarication had
been exhausted. In short, it was an authoritative retractation
of the flaming medical testimony with which
vaccination had been commended to the public in 1800,
when the heads of the profession thought it their duty
to declare in the newspapers&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That those persons who have had the Cowpox are perfectly secure
from the future infection of the Smallpox.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">And of Jenner’s emphatic assurance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of the
genuine Cowpox is never afterwards, at any period of its existence,
assailable by the Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>The occasion of Jeffrey’s article was the publication
by Dr. John Thomson of a treatise on a violent epidemic
in Edinburgh, and other parts of Scotland, in 1818-19.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
The disease differed from ordinary smallpox in respect of
the smallness of the pustules, which contained a milky
fluid, and began to dry up on the fourth or fifth day. In
Thomson’s words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The epidemic appeared to exhibit all the varieties of Smallpox
from the mildest to the most malignant; and it was curious to
observe that the mildest forms, as well as the most malignant,
were strictly vesicular eruptions, in which scarcely a trace of purulent
matter was to be seen from their commencement to their termination.</p></div>

<p>Whether this epidemic was smallpox or chickenpox,
was the question. It was chickenpox said some. It was
modified smallpox said others. It probably was chickenpox
said Thomson; and if so, he argued, chickenpox
should be accounted a variety of smallpox. The chief
cause of uncertainty was, that the vaccinated constituted
the majority of sufferers&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had the unvaccinated alone been attacked [wrote Thomson],
nothing, it appears to me, but the most unreasonable scepticism
could ever have suggested a doubt of the disease being genuine
Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>Thomson reported 556 cases in Edinburgh of which&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad4 fs80">
310 had been Vaccinated;<br />
&nbsp; 41 had had Smallpox; and<br />
205 had neither been Vaccinated nor had Smallpox.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">And William Gibson, surgeon at Robert Owen’s mills,
New Lanark, had 322 cases, of which&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad4 fs80">
251 had been Vaccinated.<br />
&nbsp; 11 had had Smallpox, spontaneous or inoculated.<br />
&nbsp; 57 had neither been Vaccinated nor had Smallpox.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 had had Smallpox and Cowpox simultaneously.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>As is usual in epidemics of smallpox, it was the
young who were the majority of sufferers; Thomson
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The epidemic has been observed to attack those chiefly who were
under ten years of age; <em>increasing years appearing in general to
lessen the susceptibility to Smallpox contagion</em>.</p></div>

<p>Thomson supported his opinion that chickenpox and
smallpox were interchangeable varieties of variola with
much cogent evidence and argument. He cited instances
in which they occurred together, one constitution bringing
forth chickenpox where another brought forth
smallpox, whilst the infection of one appeared at times
in the manifestation of the other. The controversy
is not one on which it is necessary to pronounce judgment
beyond saying that the whole drift of philosophic
pathology is now in Thomson’s favour; and indeed
at the time he wrote, his position would not have been
seriously contested, save for the discredit it accumulated
upon vaccination. One of Thomson’s correspondents, P.
Mudie, M.D., of St. Andrews, stated the difficulty with
artless force. He wrote, 18th October, 1818&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of late years I have remarked, that the disease called Chickenpox
has been much more severe than formerly; and many of the
cases occurring after Vaccination, so much resembled Smallpox,
that <em>if my mind had not been prejudiced against the possibility of
such an occurrence</em>, I should have pronounced the eruption to have
been of a variolous nature.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding his experience, Thomson held firmly
by vaccination. Whilst compelled to admit that it did
not avert either form of variola, he maintained with
curious fervour that it made the disease milder, as if to
excuse his partial surrender of faith. We all see more or
less according to our prepossessions, and we need not
blame Thomson if with his perspicacity he was unequal
to the entire truth. The vaccinated belonged to classes
who were better housed, better fed, and better cared for
than the unvaccinated; and if their ailment had been
measles or pneumonia in place of chickenpox, they would
have all the same made better recoveries. Precisely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
same error is made at this day: what is due to kindlier
conditions of life is ascribed to vaccination.</p>

<p>Some tried to account for the manifest failure of vaccination
on the supposition that the original virus had
lost its force in transmission from arm to arm, but
Thomson would not allow that it had deteriorated. He
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Vaccine Virus used in Edinburgh for a series of eighteen
years produces exactly the same appearances as are delineated by
Dr. Jenner as characteristic of Cowpox. I know, also, that the
appearances of the vaccine vesicle produced by this matter, which
must have passed through a succession of at least 900 individuals,
agree exactly with those exhibited by vesicles produced by inoculation,
<em>with the more recent equine matter with which I have been,
lately favoured by Dr. Jenner</em>.</p></div>

<p>The latter words are noteworthy. When Jenner’s
ascription of the origin of Cowpox in Horsegrease is
referred to, the answer frequently is, that Jenner was
mistaken, and that he did not persist in his opinion. It
is true that he did preserve a judicious silence about
horsegrease when he saw that it would mar rather than
make his fortune. But when he obtained all he was
likely to get, he resumed the expression of his original
opinion, and used and diffused what he described as horsegrease;
and the vesicles raised by the virus, and the cicatrices
which remained were identical with those induced
by so-called Cowpox.</p>

<p>Another point developed in Thomson’s evidence was
the mistake made crediting vaccination with the prevention
of smallpox where there was no smallpox to prevent.
The victories ascribed to vaccination were victories
either over an imaginary or a retreating enemy. We
cannot too firmly insist upon this point in presence of the
claim continually advanced for the subjugation of smallpox
by vaccination. For some cause undefined, and,
probably in its full extent, undiscoverable, a subsidence
of smallpox over the whole of Europe set in toward the
close of last century, and continued during the early
years of the present; and to this subsidence the favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
that vaccination met with was largely due. The decline
in the disease concurrently with the introduction of vaccination,
was ascribed to vaccination, although the decline
prevailed among an overwhelming majority who had
never received vaccination. To make good the claim for
vaccination it would have been necessary to maintain
that the vaccine rite, as applied to 2 or 3 per cent. of
Europeans, effected the salvation of 98 or 97 per cent.
For example, a great point was made by Jenner and his
friends of the extinction of smallpox in Vienna, according
to the following table&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Yet it was never pretended that in these years more than
a fraction of the Viennese were vaccinated, or that the
death-rate of the city was reduced by the disappearance
of smallpox. The like fatuity characterised the whole of
the vaccinators’ statistics. Smallpox had declined, <em>therefore</em>,
they argued, vaccination is the cause of the decline,
and multitudes were convinced by the illicit logic. When
vaccination was, however, brought to the test of epidemic
smallpox, its inefficacy became manifest, and thus Thomson
had to avow, as the result of his experience in the
Edinburgh epidemic of 1818-19&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is to the severity of this epidemic, I am convinced, that we
ought to attribute the greatness of the number of the vaccinated
who have been attacked by it, and not to any deterioration in the
qualities of the Cowpox Virus, or to any defects in the manner in
which it has been employed. <em>Had a variolous constitution of the
atmosphere</em>, similar to that which we have lately experienced,
<em>existed at the time Dr. Jenner brought forward his discovery, it
may be doubted whether it ever could have obtained the confidence
of the public</em>.</p></div>

<p>Such was the article which Jenner “put down for
100,000 deaths at least.” Yet neither Jeffrey nor Thomson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
renounced vaccination. They agreed that whilst it
could no longer be trusted to prevent smallpox, it made
the disease milder in those it attacked. When a cherished
belief is surrendered, it is rarely unconditionally: it is
only by degrees that full concession is made unto truth.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">INTRODUCTION OF VACCINATION TO THE UNITED STATES.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Leaving England for awhile, let us see how it fared with
vaccination in some other countries.</p>

<p>As before observed, the introduction of vaccination to
practice is sometimes described, as having been a labour
of difficulty, a strife with prejudice, a victory of light over
darkness; but there was nothing in reality answering to
such magniloquence. The battle was won for vaccination
by variolation, for which it was exhibited as a harmless
and more efficient substitute. Unless the entrance of
vaccination into the place of variolation be recognised, its
quick and easy triumph is inexplicable. A novelty that
King George and Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales,
and the Royal Dukes accepted without hesitation or reserve,
could not in the nature of things have required the
exercise of much intelligence. Any serious resistance
proceeded from the variolators, who considered their
craft in danger when parsons, women, and tradesmen
were approved of as vaccinators by Jenner himself. Such
opposition to vaccination as is common at this day was
not possible in the early years of the present century.
We know that health is the best defence of health, and
that illness is proof of ill-living; but, to our forefathers,
illness was a mysterious dispensation to be encountered
with submission, relieved by prescriptions, magical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
natural. Hence not only dull Royalty was involved in
the cowpox craze, but men of science like Davy, Wollaston,
and Darwin, with the whole troop of men of letters,
of whom Sir Walter Scott may be taken for spokesman.
Describing Queen Caroline in “The Heart of Midlothian,”
he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The lady had remarkably good features, though somewhat injured
by Smallpox, that venomous scourge, which each village
Æsculapius (thanks to Jenner) can now tame as easily as his tutelary
deity tamed the Python.</p></div>

<p>For credulity thus expressed there was large excuse.
What else, indeed, could one in Scott’s position have been
expected to believe? It was only through the hard disenchantment
of experience that vaccination did not prevent
smallpox, nor mitigate its severity, nor was in itself
harmless, that the early delirium abated, and a less rabid
persuasion supervened.</p>

<p>The wave of conviction spread from England over the
world, and nowhere was the substitution of vaccination
for variolation welcomed more enthusiastically than in
New England. As Boston led the way in 1721 in the
practice of smallpox inoculation, so from Boston in 1800
was announced the project for the extermination of
smallpox by cowpox. But ere advancing farther, it may
be well to say a word about Boston smallpox.</p>

<p>Boston was an extremely unhealthy town. For fifty
years, from 1701 to 1750, the births were exceeded by
the deaths. In a population of about 15,000, the annual
death rate ranged from 30 to 70 per thousand. There
were epidemics of fever and of smallpox; the latter
occurring in general at intervals of ten years, when large
numbers died, the smallpox as usual displacing other
forms of fever, but nevertheless raising the mortality of
the year. The most deadly outbreak of smallpox was
that of 1721, the year in which Cotton Mather and
Zabdiel Boylston introduced variolation. The mortality
of that year was 1102, of which 884 were ascribed to
smallpox. In 1752 there was an extraordinary epidemic,
but how much of its prevalence was due to circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and how much to contrivance, it is impossible to divine.
Here are the figures, which are of singular interest&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80"><span class="smcap">Boston</span> in 1752. Population 15,684.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under these heads the entire population of 15,684 was
accounted for, with the important exception of the
discrimination of the 5998, whose immunity was presupposed,
into subjects of induced and spontaneous smallpox.
The deaths, 569, were less numerous than in 1721,
when 884 died, but the disease was more widely diffused,
upwards of one-third of the inhabitants, 5545, being
attacked. The epidemic exhausted itself within four
months, the record standing thus&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p class="noindent">The diffusion of the epidemic was largely due to the
extensive variolation that went on, no fewer than 2124
having been inoculated in the panic, and they moving
freely about in the assurance of safety, spread the distemper
on every side. For every five who had the
smallpox, so to say, naturally, two had it artificially, and
the one sort was almost as “catching” as the other. It
was an instance of a community (excepting the 1843
who fled) rushing into smallpox to escape from smallpox.
The deaths of 24 Whites and 6 Blacks from variolation
gave rise to much concern, and by some they were spoken
of as so many murders. Against this fatality was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
set the low death rate of the regular sufferers, 539 out
of 5545, or less than 1 in 10. The Rev. T. Prince, who
communicated an account of the epidemic to the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> for 1753, p. 413, was puzzled to account
for the variation from the London standard&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Jurin computes that there generally die in London in the
natural way 2 in 11 or 18 in the 100; but in Boston we see that
not more than 1 in 10 died; whilst in the inoculated way the deaths
were more numerous than is commonly allowed. What were the
natural causes, under their Divine Director, of Smallpox in the
natural way being less mortal in Boston than in London, and more
mortal in Boston than in London in the inoculated way, may be
worthy of our humble inquiries.</p></div>

<p>The difference was broader than Prince perceived. An
outbreak of smallpox in which a third of the population
was affected never occurred in London, and a mortality
proportionate with that of Boston among a third of the
Londoners would have appeared like a recurrence of the
Plague. I am in nowise concerned to minimise the
ravages of smallpox when conditions are prepared, as of
design, for its development; but I do insist on their
accurate definition. Boston suffered severely, but was
by no means “decimated”&mdash;the invariable rhetorical
phrase. The deaths were at the rate of 1 in 27, and, as
observed, smallpox replaced other forms of fever. The
539 deaths from smallpox were not extra deaths; the
excess was less than half that number, and might fairly
be attributed to the extraordinary energy displayed in
propagating the disease by inoculation.</p>

<p>Spite of such adverse experience, variolation continued
to be a common, though intermittent, practice in America,
and especially in New England, where the habit of doctoring
for the cure of present ailments, and the prevention
of anticipated ones, was established and inveterate. In
Boston the practice became systematised, and the inoculated
were confined for three weeks to an hospital situated
on a promontory in the Charles River, where they were
treated as veritable centres of infection&mdash;a course widely
different from that pursued in the epidemic of 1752.
Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that smallpox was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
ever endemic in New England as it was in London.
Dr. Waterhouse writing in 1787 observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by
Smallpox in all the four New England Governments, that is, not
one in a million of people.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The disease broke out now and then, and was always
traced to some wayfarer, or ship, or parcel of goods&mdash;never
to bad drainage, or no drainage, or the stenches
that pervaded the domestic interiors of last century,
whether in America or Europe. In this matter, the
exercise of a little imagination is requisite to realise the
historic facts: they are disagreeable; but if people will
insist on comparing the smallpox of the 18th century
with that of the 19th, it may become necessary to be
explicit as to certain domestic details concerning which
there is a conventional reserve.</p>

<p>It was by Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, Professor of the
Theory and Practice of Physic in the University of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, that vaccination was introduced
to America. He described the new rite in the <cite>Columbian
Centinel</cite> of 12th March, 1799, as “Something Curious in
the Medical Line”; and formally promulgated the novelty
a year afterwards in a pamphlet thus entitled&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite>A Prospect of Exterminating the Smallpox; being the History
of the Variolæ Vaccinæ, or Kine-Pox, commonly called the Cowpox,
as it has appeared in England: with an Account of a Series
of Inoculations performed for the Kine-Pox in Massachusetts.</cite>
Printed for the Author at the Cambridge Press by William Hilliard
and sold by him and other Booksellers in Boston. 1800.</p></div>

<p>Kine-Pox! Why Kine-Pox? The reason is stated by
the Doctor&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From kine the plural of cow; thus in the Scriptures, “And they
took two milch-kine, and shut up their calves at home”; a word
equally expressive, and, in the opinion of some, more delicate.</p></div>

<p>There we have it: <em>More delicate</em>! If it had been
bull-pox the objection might have been insuperable.
Writing to Jenner, 24th April, 1801, Waterhouse says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Could you believe that not a single inoculation with Cowpox has
yet been effected in Philadelphia? It seems that the leading</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
physician there pronounces it too beastly and indelicate for polished
society.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p></div>

<p>The pamphlet on Kine-Pox set forth the mystery of
the new inoculation as received from England with a
significant omission&mdash;there was not a word in it about
Horsegrease! Waterhouse was in correspondence with
Pearson, and Pearson may have told him how not only
the asserted generation of Cowpox in Horsegrease was
discredited, but “how it was like to damn the whole
thing”; which might have been true enough, but if true,
Where then stood Jenner? He knew that cowpox did
not prevent smallpox: the fact was notorious among
the medical men in cowpox districts: and he had expressly
pledged his faith in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> to Cowpox
begotten from Horsegrease and to nothing else. But
Horsegrease Cowpox did not suit the market, and it was
withdrawn with Jenner’s tacit assent, and spontaneous
Cowpox advanced in its stead, and accepted as Jenner’s
veritable discovery. It might be good business to drop
the horse out of the case, but what was it else?</p>

<p>Cowpox, testified Waterhouse, was unknown in New
England, but he received the revelation concerning it at
once&mdash;but <em>not</em>, be it repeated, Jenner’s revelation: <em>that</em>
he suppressed. He had long suspected that smallpox
was communicated from brutes to the human race; and
now his suspicion was confirmed. And, such being the
origin of variola, it seemed to him not unreasonable that
the disease as it existed in a mild form in kine might be
used for inoculation with all the advantages pertaining
to smallpox, whilst attended with neither injury to the
inoculated, nor with risk of infection to those about
them&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What makes this newly discovered disease so very curious, and
so extremely important is, that every person thus affected, is ever
after secured from the ordinary Smallpox, let him be ever so much
exposed to the effect of it, or let ever so much ripe Smallpox matter
be inserted into the skin by inoculation. In other words, a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
who has undergone the local disease and specific fever occasioned
by the Cowpox Infection is thereby rendered ever after insusceptible
of the Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>How incautious, to say the least, was the acceptance
of this prophecy of perpetual security! With less than
three years’ experience an absolute prediction was delivered,
received, and repeated over the whole earth as
if by parrots. Such, however, is the habit of mankind
when possessed by a strong delusion.</p>

<p>In justice to Waterhouse it has to be said that he did
not commit himself openly until he had gone through
the illusory experiments that were then fashionable in
England. He had much difficulty in obtaining a supply
of active virus. Several remittances failed, but at last
he had one, an inch and a-half of infected thread, from
Dr. Haygarth which proved, it was thought, effective.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
His first patient was his son, Daniel Oliver, aged five;
then another child aged three; then a servant lad aged
twelve; then a weaned infant of one year&mdash;all five successful,
whilst two domestics failed “to take”&mdash;seven
experiments in his own household. Then he had the
children taken to the Smallpox Hospital, where they
were inoculated by Dr. Aspinwall, and issuing scatheless
from the test, the truth was taken as demonstrated, and
there was no need for further hesitation. Four gentlemen,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'including a physican'">including a physician</ins>, offered themselves for public
encouragement&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of them [says Waterhouse] chose to live pretty freely by
way of experiment, and the febrile symptoms, especially headache,
were full as much as he could bear and walk about with. This
convinced me that the Kine-Pox was a disease not to be trifled
with.</p></div>

<p>Waterhouse then appealed to the pride of his countrymen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people of New England, particularly of Boston, set a noble
example to their elder brethren of Old England, in adopting the
Turkish practice of Inoculation for the Smallpox in 1721. Now
the English in their turn, lead the way in a practice still more
salutiferous. For though the Inoculation which commenced here
in 1721, stripped that horrid disease, the Smallpox, of more than
half its terrors, yet it is the Kine-Pox that will effect its extermination.</p></div>

<p>Following this prophecy came a frank request for
business&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Waterhouse informs those who have applied to him out of
Cambridge to inoculate their families that he declined it only until
the disorder had gone fairly through his own family, and until some
of them had been inoculated by Dr. Aspinwall, and otherwise exposed
to Smallpox. But having now confirmed his assertion, that
the Kine-Pox protects the constitution from the infection of
Smallpox by a fair experiment, he is ready to attend them whenever
they choose. Those who live in Boston may rest assured that
from the proximity of his residence to the capital, he shall make
such arrangements as to be able to attend them as punctually as if
he resided there.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, 18th <em>August</em>, 1800.</p></div>

<p>After an English pattern he published the following
table&mdash;</p>

<div class="p1 fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

    <td class="tdlx bl">It is like crossing the stream on a new and safe bridge.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The operations, so hopefully begun, came speedily to
grief. In a letter addressed by Waterhouse to Jenner,
24th April, 1801, we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One inch and a-half of infected thread from Dr. Haygarth was
the whole stock from whence perhaps 3000 persons have been inoculated,
<em>but I fear the greatest part of them have been spurious</em>.
I gave out that the winter was an unfavourable season for this new
inoculation, and by that means I suspended the practice throughout
the country until the arrival of fresh matter and your letter. Now
we are going on again, but not with the faith and spirit of the last
season. Some unlucky cases have damped the ardour of a people
who received this new inoculation with a candour, liberality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
and even generosity, much to their credit. The first political
and literary characters in our nation are still warm advocates for
the practice.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p></div>

<p>Waterhouse continued to correspond with Jenner, and
was regarded as his accredited representative in New
England. Writing to Dr. Lettsom, 16th November, 1802,
he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Jenner has just sent me a present I highly prize&mdash;a silver
box inlaid with gold of exquisite taste and workmanship, bearing
this inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edward Jenner</span> to <span class="smcap">Benjamin Waterhouse</span>.</p>

<p class="pad4">From <span class="smcap">the Jenner</span> of <span class="smcap">the Old World</span></p>

</div>

<p>Waterhouse was a man of an ingenious turn of mind.
When troubled with ill-results from his operations at the
end of 1800, he tried what has since been called retro-vaccination,
probably for the first time. Here are his
words from his letter to Jenner, 24th April, 1801&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I inoculated one of my cows with the Vaccine Virus, and obtained
from her a crop of matter on the ninth day, which produced the
disease in the human subject to perfection. Is this experiment
known among you? As I operated myself there was no avenue
opened for deception in the whole experiment.</p></div>

<p>A sentence which follows is too characteristic to be
passed over. Says Waterhouse&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have invariably found that weakly children have been benefited
by the Vaccine Inoculation, and some it has cured of the
Hooping Cough.</p></div>

<p>And this after less than twelve months’ experience!</p>

<p>Waterhouse had also to relate a case of cows having
smallpox&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>At one of our periodical inoculations, which occur in New England
once in eight or nine years,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> several farmers drove their cows
to an hospital near a populous village, that the patients might have
the benefit of their milk. The cows were milked by persons in all
stages of Smallpox; and in consequence they had an eruptive disorder
on their teats and udders that every one in the hospital, as
well as the physician who told me, declared was Smallpox. Since
Cowpox has been talked of, this account has been revived and
credited. Have you found anything like it in England?</p></div>

<p>Waterhouse had inquiries from Virginia, and wished
Jenner to let him have, if possible, a picture of the
vaccine vesicle on the negro&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Could I procure two or three coloured plates, delineating the
appearances on the skin of the negro, I would send them into such
of our Southern States as are blackened by these degraded beings.</p></div>

<p>“Some in this country, as well as in England,” observed
Waterhouse, “having had all their objections to
Kine-Pox obviated, persist in asking, ‘Who can tell what
may be the consequences in the lapse of years of introducing
a bestial humour into the human frame?’ I
answer them as does Mr. Ring with a spirit and wit
worthy of Franklin, ‘Who can tell what may be the
consequences in the lapse of years of introducing milk,
beef steaks, or mutton chops, into the human frame?’”</p>

<p>The pertinacity with which this “wit” was employed
by the early vaccinators leads us to suppose that they
found it effective; but was ever argument by analogy
more absurdly misapplied? Milk or steaks from a cow,
or chops from a sheep known to be suffering from pox
would be rejected with loathing; nor was it ever proposed
to cook and eat cowpox; and yet corruption, mere
association with which, would render milk, or steaks, or
chops loathsome, it was not thought abominable to infuse
into the blood!</p>

<p>“The first political and literary characters in our nation
are warm advocates of the practice,” said Waterhouse;
and it was so. President Adams was quite of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
mind with King George in that respect; and Jefferson
not only approved of the practice in common with Queen
Charlotte, but, as soon as he could obtain virus, set to
work with his sons-in-law, and vaccinated their families
and neighbours to the number of two hundred. There
is a letter from Jefferson to Jenner in 1806, which is
remarkable as an absolute confession of faith at a date
when much had occurred to shake faith. The President
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Monticello, Virginia</span>, <em>14th May, 1806</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received the copy of the evidence at large respecting
the discovery of the Vaccine Inoculation, which you have been
pleased to send me, and for which I return you my thanks. Having
been among the early converts in this part of the globe to
its efficacy, I took an early part in recommending it to my countrymen.
I avail myself of this occasion to render to you my portion
of the tribute of gratitude due to you from the whole human
family. Medicine has never before produced any single improvement
of such utility. Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the
blood was a beautiful addition to our knowledge of the animal
economy; but on a review of the practice of medicine before and
since that epoch, I do not see any great amelioration which has
been derived from that discovery. You have erased from the
calendar of human afflictions one of its greatest. Yours is the comfortable
reflection that mankind can never forget that you have
lived. Future nations will know by history only that the loathsome
Smallpox has existed, and by you has been extirpated. Accept
the most fervent wishes for your health and happiness, and assurances
of the greatest respect and consideration.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Th. Jefferson.</span></p></div>

<p>That smallpox should be erased from the calendar of
human afflictions, and be known only in history as extirpated
by Jenner, were vain expectations; but to
recognise their vanity did not lie within Jefferson’s possibilities.
He had been bred in the belief that inoculation
with smallpox prevented smallpox, and it came forth as
a corollary, that as cowpox was an equivalent for smallpox,
if all were cowpoxed, the disease must be extirpated.
His expectations, therefore, were not without plausibility.
Nor was it possible for Jefferson in the light of his time
to see that smallpox was no specific entity that could be
got rid of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> whilst all else remained unaffected. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
know that if even vaccination made an end of smallpox,
and did no harm of itself, we should reduce neither illness
nor mortality (supposing no other change in the conditions
of existence were effected), but should have our
due allotment of disease in other forms. To attack smallpox
as smallpox, and suppose that if suppressed we should
be in anywise advantaged, is mere illusion. Zymotic
diseases, to be dealt with effectually, must be dealt with
as forms of a common malady; to get rid of one, we must
get rid of all; and with a graver sense of the difficulties
to be encountered we, too, believe with Jefferson, that
smallpox may be extirpated, but in company with much
else, and by practice that has no affinity with the creation
of disease implied in vaccination.</p>

<p>Of all people the English are most abandoned to medical
quackery, said Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; and the
English characteristic was reproduced and exaggerated
in New England. The first resistance to vaccination being
overcome, there was a run upon the practice&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The zeal of American medical men [says Baron] was excited to
an unparalleled degree; but, unfortunately, their discretion did not
keep pace with it. They disregarded the cautions of Dr. Waterhouse,
and paid no attention either to the state of the matter with
which they inoculated, or to the progress of the pustule. It appears,
likewise, that the cupidity of persons not of the medical profession
was stimulated, and the manner in which they carried on their
traffic was alike indicative of their avarice and their ignorance.
The followers of this trade obtained the shirt-sleeves of patients
which had been stiffened by the purulent discharge from an ulcer
consequent on Vaccination. These they cut into strips, and sold
about the country as impregnated with the true Vaccine Virus.
Several hundred persons were actually inoculated with the poison,
which, in several cases, produced great disturbance in the constitution.
A vessel arrived from London at Marblehead with a
sailor on board, who was supposed to have Cowpox: matter was
taken from him, and was used extensively. It was soon discovered
that Smallpox matter had been employed, and <em>that</em> disease spread
rapidly through the neighbourhood. These blunders, it is to be
feared, were not confined to vagrant quacks, inasmuch as medical
men were not quite blameless.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst such doings discredited vaccination in one way,
they served it in another: they made it easy to conceal
its failures and injuries by ascribing them to the use of
spurious virus. Everything is to be gained for truth in
the question of vaccination by taking it in what its
believers allow to be its unexceptionable form, so as to
leave no room for evasion. Smallpox in America as in
England soon showed itself indifferent to the art of the
vaccinator, and then it was settled that at least it made
the disease milder; and under cover of the convenient
fiction, it continued to be practised where fees were to
be had for the performance.</p>

<p>The attitude of the medical mind to epidemics, and
the ignorance of what we now regard as the first elements
of sanitary science, are illustrated with touching
sincerity in a letter addressed by Dr. Waterhouse, in
1817, to the surgeons of the United States army. Said
the Jenner of the New World&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You need not waste your time, or distract your attention by
guessing at the remote causes of dysenteries or epidemic fevers.
We learn from the highest authority, that the pestilence “walketh
in darkness.” The enemy approaches unseen. We are pretty well
convinced that epidemic fevers depend not on any of those changes
in the air that are pointed out by the thermometer, barometer,
or hygrometer. These wide-spreading maladies, as well as endemics,
or local disorders, seem as if they arose from some secret movements,
or alterations in the earth, or on its surface&mdash;that is, on some
new combinations in the soil, or some effluvium from a deeper
situation, affecting not only the air we breathe, but the water which
we use for everything. Epidemics seem to accompany or follow
a blighted state of vegetation. They seem also to accompany an
abundant harvest; but whether in the series of cause and effect is not
fully known. As to myself, I’m weary of conjecture.</p></div>

<p>Well might he be weary! He does not say so, but neither
does he make any reserve in favour of vaccination; and,
after seventeen years’ trial of it, the old physician must
have included it in his cry of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanitas Vanitatum!</i></p>

<span class="chap-hdr">INTRODUCTION OF VACCINATION TO INDIA AND THE EAST.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The enthusiasm for cowpox in England was reproduced
with fury among the English in India. It is always
so. What is the fashion at home is an intenser fashion
abroad.</p>

<p>When we say India, we speak as of a country when we
are dealing with a continent&mdash;of not one but many
peoples, of races numerous and tongues various: wherefore,
in naming India, I would be understood as limiting
my remarks to the portion designated, and to the population
affected by English influence. In several parts of
India smallpox is endemic&mdash;begotten in permanently unwholesome
conditions of life, and cultivated and propagated
by inoculation. When, therefore, it was heard that
cowpox might be substituted for smallpox, and that the
mild served every purpose of the severe disease, there
arose a demand among the English for the virus, alike for
their own and for native use. Dr. Underwood, writing
to Jenner from Madras, 28th Feb., 1801, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have read with very great pleasure your publications on Cowpox,
and feel particularly anxious to introduce and extend it in this
country, under the greatest confidence that it would save many
lives. I have hitherto embraced every opportunity of inoculating
with variolous matter, but the loss of a beautiful little patient has
humbled me, and I confess I never now take up a lancet but with
fear and trembling.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p></div>

<p>It was easier to ask than to obtain. There was no
cowpox to be heard of in India, and the long voyage
round the Cape, and the tropical heat were fatal to its
transmission. Repeated attempts were made, but all
ended in failure. Jenner proposed to place a number of
picked men on board an East Indiaman, and to have
them successively vaccinated in the course of the voyage,
so as to land with fresh virus in Bombay or Calcutta;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
but the East India Company declined the proposal. An
attempt was then made to raise a subscription for the
purpose, Jenner putting his name down for 1,000 guineas;
though it was difficult to imagine where the 1,000 guineas
were to come from, unless out of the pockets of some of
his admirers.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>These efforts were, however, superseded by the energy
and ingenuity of Dr. De Carro, of Vienna. Lord Elgin,
British ambassador to the Porte, had made acquaintance
with De Carro, and had received virus from him with
which his infant son and others were vaccinated at Constantinople.
The news spreading abroad, Lord Elgin was
entreated to meet the Indian demand, sending the vaccine
overland to Bombay by way of Bagdad and Bussora.
He made several futile attempts, and thereon determined
to place the matter in the hands of De Carro; and for
that purpose addressed himself to the Hon. Arthur Paget,
British ambassador at Vienna, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have so many applications for Vaccine Virus from Bussora, the
East Indies, and Ceylon, that I beg you will immediately apply to
Dr. De Carro, and request him to send some by every courier.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p></div>

<p>De Carro accepted the commission with alacrity. He
had already had an application from Bagdad, and, dismissing
the vehicles which had been tried and failed,
such as lancets of steel, silver, gold, and ivory, and threads
enclosed in quills, he saturated lint with virus, and, placing
it between glasses, in one of which was a cavity for
its reception, tied them together, sealed the edges, and,
taking them to a wax chandler, had them dipped until
enclosed in a ball of wax, which was packed in a box
stuffed with shreds of paper. In this manner virus was
conveyed through Constantinople, across the deserts to
Bagdad, where it was received on 31st March, 1802, still
liquid, and was used “with complete success.” The like
success was reported from Bussora, Muscat, and Bushire.
From Bussora virus was conveyed to Bombay, arriving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
after a three weeks’ voyage, early in June. Twenty or
thirty were inoculated with the Vienna virus, but only
one “took,” namely, Anna Dusthall, a child about three
years of age, who was operated upon by Dr. Helenus
Scott. The progress of the case was watched with intense
anxiety, and correspondent satisfaction when the
symptoms developed according to the recognised description.
On the eighth day five children were vaccinated
from Dusthall’s arm, and loud was the rejoicing when it
was known that for India was secured the genuine Variolæ
Vaccinæ. From Bombay “the precious fluid” was in
due course conveyed to Ceylon, Madras, Calcutta, and
wherever English influence prevailed. De Carro was
naturally elated with his success. The virus he transmitted
was originally obtained from the stock of Dr.
Sacco, of Milan, who had it off some Lombard cows.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Jenner wrote to De Carro to congratulate him, 28th
March, 1803&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since the commencement of our correspondence, great as my
satisfaction has been in the perusal of your letters, I do not recollect
when you have favoured me with one that has afforded me
pleasure equal to the last. The regret I have experienced at finding
that every endeavour to send the Vaccine Virus to India in
perfection has again failed, is scarcely to be described to you; judge,
then, what pleasure you convey in assuring me that my wishes are
accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p></div>

<p>The imported cowpox was diffused and recommended
with energy and with fraud. Jenner, writing to Dunning,
2nd November, 1804, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Conceiving it might be a gratification to you to see how systematically
they manage vaccine affairs in India, I have sent you a
copy of a paper just transmitted to me from the India House.
Would to Heaven we could boast of such arrangements here!</p></div>

<p>Here is the paper which sets forth the energetic policy
pursued&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fort-William</span>, <em>15th January, 1804</em>.</p>

<p>With a view of extending the practice of Vaccine Inoculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
throughout the East India Company’s territories in India, the Governor-General
in Council of Bengal has appointed a Superintendent-General
of Vaccine Inoculation at the Presidency, and established
subordinate superintendents at several of the interior stations
of the country; namely, at Decca, Moorshedabad, Patna, Benares,
Allahabad, Cawnpore, and Farruckabad. These superintendents
are the surgeons of the stations, and are to act under the orders of
the Superintendent-General in whatever regards Vaccine Inoculation.
The civil surgeons also at the several judicial and revenue
stations are to co-operate with these superintendents for the purpose
of forwarding the general object.</p>

<p>Vaccine Inoculation has also been introduced with success into
Prince of Wales Island, and it is intended to extend the practice to
Malacca and other places to the eastward; and a confident expectation
is entertained that the benefits of this valuable discovery
will be diffused throughout Asia. It is even in contemplation to
extend it to China; but as the suspicious disposition of the Chinese
might possibly ascribe any attempt to introduce this novel practice
to sinister motives, it has been postponed until the opinion of the
Company’s servants there can be obtained.</p></div>

<p>Much of this policy was due to the Marquis Wellesley,
the Governor-General, whose habit it was to convert conviction
without delay into performance. To what extent
it was found practicable to substitute vaccination for
variolation among the natives does not clearly appear.
It was comparatively easy to operate upon those immediately
dependent upon their conquerors; but it was a
different matter to disarm the aversion of the external
myriads. Supposing the variolators preferred their
ancient practice because it was more lucrative, a number
of them were brought to Calcutta, and inquiry made as
to the amount of their gains, which ascertained, they
were offered double pay if they would adopt vaccination.
The offer was readily accepted, and other variolators,
hearing of it, volunteered their services on similar terms,
and were instructed and enrolled as official vaccinators.
A declaration was drawn up and signed by twenty-six
of these converted variolators, recommending vaccination
to the Eastern world. The declaration was published in
the <cite>Calcutta Gazette</cite>, printed in four languages, and
widely circulated throughout India.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>So much was possible to Government; but other means
of persuasion were not neglected. It was at first imagined
that pox from the cow would exactly suit people
who held that animal in reverence; but, on the contrary,
the fact was converted by the Brahmins into an argument
against its use, they contending, and justly, that
cowpox was impure. To meet this difficulty, various
pious frauds were attempted. It was pretended that
vaccination was no novelty in India, and that it was
known, sanctioned, and practised from time immemorial.
Baron, Jenner’s biographer, relates these details without
animadversion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A native physician of Bareilly put into the hands of Mr. Gillman,
who was surgeon at that station, some leaves purporting to be an
extract from a Sanscrit work on medicine, entitled “Sud’ha Sangreha,”
by a physician named Mahadeva, to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take the matter of pustules, which are naturally produced on
the teats of Cows, carefully preserve it, and before the breaking
out of Smallpox make with a fine instrument a small puncture
(like that made by a gnat) in a child’s limb, and introduce into the
blood as much of that matter as is measured by a quarter of a ratti.
Thus the wise physician renders the child secure from the eruption
of the Smallpox.”</p></div>

<p>The Sanscrit work from which this passage was asserted
to be taken was never forthcoming, and by competent
authorities was pronounced “nothing more than a well-meant
device for the reduction of ignorant prejudices,” the
native physician who put the leaves into the hands of Mr.
Gillman being included in the fiction. Baron continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order to overcome these native prejudices the late Mr. Ellis,
of Madras, who was well versed in Sanscrit literature, actually
composed a short poem in that language on Vaccination. The
poem was written on old paper, and was said to have been <em>found</em>,
that the impression of its antiquity might assist the effect intended
to be produced on the minds of the Brahmins while tracing the prevention
to their sacred cow.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Anderson, of Madras, adopted the very same expedient,
in order to deceive the Hindoos into a belief that Vaccination
was an ancient practice of their own. It is scarcely necessary to
observe that had any authentic record of such a practice existed
these gentlemen would never have resorted to such contrivances to
gain their object.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>These impostors were not priests, but medical men; not
Jesuits, but Protestants; not Levantines, but Englishmen
in the service of the Honourable East India Company.
To what extent their frauds were operative is not related.
They were probably too contemptuous of native acumen.
For good and for evil the Hindoo listens to English advice
courteously and without contradiction, but persists
in his accustomed way of life with the equanimity of
indifference. That vaccination was an ancient practice
in India came to be repeated in Europe and seriously
believed, when, Jenner’s originality being impugned, the
truth came out, that old Indian vaccination was a device
limited to Indian circumstances, and never designed for
Western acceptance.</p>

<p>In Madras vaccination was practised with much
energy. Jenner, writing on 7th May, 1808, said, “Wonderful
to relate, the numbers vaccinated in that Presidency
in the course of last year amount to 243,175.”<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
In Bombay it was claimed that smallpox was extirpated;
Dr. Helenus Scott reporting, 5th December, 1806, that
“in this island, swarming with mankind, no loss from
smallpox has been suffered for several years since the introduction
of vaccine inoculation.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It was not pretended
that all the inhabitants of Bombay had been
vaccinated, or even a considerable portion of them; but
the early vaccinators appear to have regarded vaccination
as a sort of charm, the possession of which kept off smallpox;
that by the vaccination, say, of one-tenth of any
population, the unvaccinated nine-tenths were protected.
This faith in the vicarious efficacy of vaccination was
not expressly avowed, but was implied in the numerous
reports of extirpated smallpox in circumstances where no
attempt was made, or was indeed possible, to effect universal
vaccination.</p>

<p>Confuted and frustrated in England, it was Jenner’s
habit to sigh, and turn from his ungrateful country
to the vast realms of Europe and Asia and America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Writing to Dunning, on 23rd December, 1804, he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Foreigners hear, with the utmost astonishment, that in some
parts of England there are persons who still inoculate for Smallpox.
It must, indeed, excite their wonder when they see that
disease totally exterminated in some of their largest cities and in
wide-extended districts around them.</p></div>

<p>Mark the words&mdash;Smallpox totally exterminated in
some of the largest cities in 1804; that was to say, after,
<em>at the utmost</em>, five years’ acquaintance with vaccination!
A miraculous time&mdash;was it not? Jenner went on&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let us not, my friends, vex ourselves too much at what we see
here. Let us consider this country as but a speck when compared
with the wide surface of our planet, over which, thank God! Vaccinia
has everywhere shed her influence. From the potentate to
the peasant, in every country but this, she is received with grateful
and open arms. What an admirable arrangement is that made by
the Marquis of Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, for the
extermination of the Smallpox in that quarter of the globe! Contrasted
with our efforts here, what pigmies we appear.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p></div>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne ignotum pro magnifico est.</i> What inference
worth a straw could Jenner or anyone else draw from
the introduction of vaccination to India? The number
of the various Indian peoples was unknown; and the
periods and prevalence of smallpox among them; also
the extent to which they practised variolation. In the
absence of such elementary information, tales of the
triumphs of vaccination in India were so much romance.</p>

<p>So far as vaccination displaced variolation, it might be
taken as the substitution of a less evil for a greater; and
much is accounted for in some of the early records of
vaccination when it is remembered that the new practice
was welcomed as a deliverance from the inconveniences
and horrors of the old; and that the discredited practice
was frequently abandoned without resort to its successor.
A cessation of variolation was a cessation of the culture
and diffusion of smallpox; and vaccination had often
the credit of the reduction of smallpox when the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
was due to the abatement of variolation. As to the propagation
of smallpox by variolation, no one was more
emphatic than Jenner, as for example&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Where Variolous Inoculation is put in practice, Smallpox must
necessarily spread.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Smallpox will never be subdued so long as men can be hired to
spread the contagion by Inoculation.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p></div>

<p>If then it be taken as conceded that variolation spread
smallpox wherever practised, can it be fair to omit the
consideration of the consequences of its abatement when
estimating the results of the introduction of vaccination?
Yet scarcely an advocate of vaccination permits the fact
to enter into his reckoning!</p>

<p>The gratitude of the English in India to Jenner did
not evaporate without substantial expression. A subscription
was started, and between 1806 and 1812 he
received remittances to the amount of £7,383, the contributors
being&mdash;</p>

<tr><td class="tdl">Madras,</td><td class="tdr">1,383</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>An amusing instance of Jenner’s ignorance of India
is found in a letter to Dunning, 14th March, 1807,
wherein he ascribes his English money from India to the
gratitude of Hindoo women&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will be pleased to hear that the <em>dingy</em> Hindoo ladies are
convincing me of their grateful remembrance, not merely in words,
but by a <em>tangible</em> offering, while my <em>fair</em> Christian countrywomen
pass me unheeded by.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p></div>

<p>Jenner, in returning thanks to Dr. Fleming, of Calcutta,
for the first remittance of cash in 1806, took occasion to
communicate some English news, which is not without
interest at this day. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To say the truth, this country has been dreadfully supine in the
matter of Vaccination hitherto. Some pamphlets, full of the grossest
misrepresentations and forgeries, have been spread; and the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
people became so terrified, particularly when told that their
children, if vaccinated, would take the similitudes of bulls and cows,
that a great dislike to the practice has arisen among them; and
these accounts have been circulated through the country with
peculiar industry. The consequence has been the re-introduction of
Variolous Inoculation, which has produced an epidemic Smallpox
through the metropolis and the whole island, except in those parts
where Vaccination had previously been so generally adopted as to
forbid its approach. This, now too late, has opened their eyes, and
they see the powers of the Cowpox. The folly of the oppositionists
has gone so far as to exhibit prints of children undergoing transformation
from the human being into that of the brute.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></div>

<p>These prints were, many of them, intended for fun,
and could have no serious influence. The decline of
faith in vaccination was due to the general discovery
that it did <em>not</em> prevent smallpox, and that it <em>did</em> excite
other ailments. “It made smallpox milder” was the
apology even then coming into vogue. As for the epidemic
of smallpox raised in London and the whole island
by the neglect of vaccination and a return to variolation,
it was a creation of Jenner’s fancy. There was less
smallpox in London in 1806 than in 1805; but if there
was not more, the bold Jennerian would answer, there
<em>ought</em> to have been, and it could only be through the
mercy of Providence that there was not.</p>

<p>Throughout the century, the English in India have
spared no pains to diffuse and enforce vaccination among
the inhabitants, numerous medical men finding place and
pay in the futile occupation. Smallpox can only be
overcome by systematic sanitation, which is laborious
and difficult; and among peoples whose conditions and
habits of life freely generate zymotic disease, vaccination
is as likely to be effective as any other sort of incantation.
Sir Richard Temple states the position at this day
in these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox is universally prevalent in India, carrying off tens of
thousands of victims, children especially, in almost every province
year by year, and impairing or disfiguring others for life. The
Government has for many years made persistent efforts to arrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the disease by means of Vaccination, with remarkable success in
some districts, like that of Kumaon in the Himalayas, but generally
with indifferent success, and often without any perceptible result.
The practice of Vaccination not being in vogue, Inoculation used
to be largely adopted by the natives in many districts, but has now
been prohibited, though not always prevented actually. The State
everywhere undertakes or encourages Vaccination. Hundreds of
native vaccinators are employed, and returns are rendered of large
numbers of persons said to be successfully vaccinated. Nevertheless
Smallpox appears again and again with terrible manifestations
before the people, and causes them to disbelieve the efficacy of
Vaccination.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p></div>

<p>We now come to Ceylon, in which vaccination was
held to have had a perfect triumph. “To Sweden and
to Ceylon,” says Baron, “Dr. Jenner was in the habit of
pointing when he wished to prove what his discovery
might accomplish; or when he lamented that fatal
obstinacy of his fellow-creatures which, with such
examples before them, could induce them to reject blessings
within their reach.”<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Sweden we shall discuss in
another chapter, and of Ceylon I may observe that a
portion of the island was taken by the British from the
Dutch in 1795, and that in several parts it was extremely
unhealthy. Smallpox was a frequent and deadly epidemic,
but to what extent there is no evidence save hearsay
and estimates from hearsay. The Dutch did not
concern themselves with the health of the natives, but
when the English took over their settlements in 1800 in
the midst of a severe epidemic, they opened hospitals for
smallpox and for inoculation with smallpox under the
supervision of Dr. Christie.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> He, hearing the glad tidings
of vaccination, resolved to introduce the practice,
and having in 1802 received virus from Dr. Scott, of
Bombay, he set to work with systematic energy and perseverance.
Supported by the authority of successive
Governors, he closed the hospitals, forbade variolation,
organised a staff of vaccinators, and kept them employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
until the greater part of the population under English
influence was vaccinated. In the words of Moore,
writing in 1816&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At length the priesthood submitted to Vaccination, the last to
adopt this innovation upon their ancient customs; and the remains
of the Smallpox were happily extinguished in all that part of the
island which belonged to Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p></div>

<p>That smallpox had been exterminated by vaccination
in Ceylon was set forth by vaccinators as something indisputable;
but there were two observations to make&mdash;first,
that smallpox was often suppressed in the sense
that for a time there was no smallpox in a certain
population, and especially subsequent to a severe epidemic;
and second, that variolation was suppressed.
Granted that smallpox ceased in Ceylon coincidently with
the introduction of vaccination, it may be fairly held
that the exhaustion induced by the preceding epidemic,
and the cessation of variolation, were sufficient to account
for the phenomenon. What remains to be said of Ceylon,
I shall leave Dr. George Gregory, physician of the London
Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital, to say for me. He
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ceylon was the British colony where the Government earliest
interfered and most vigorously encouraged the practice of Vaccination.
Salaried vaccinators were scattered over the whole island.
So successful were their labours, that up to the beginning of 1819,
it had often been said that the experiment of exterminating Smallpox
had been made and successfully carried out in Ceylon. In
July, 1819, however, a severe epidemic Smallpox broke out there.
In 1830 a second epidemic overspread the island&mdash;in 1833 a third,
and in 1836 a fourth. In these four epidemics, 12,557 persons
were attacked, of whom 4,090 died, being at the rate of 33 per
cent., or one out of every three.</p>

<p>In each of these epidemics a certain number of vaccinated
persons took Smallpox. The proportion of the vaccinated to the
unprotected varied. In the third epidemic, out of a total of 460
attacked, 341 represented themselves as vaccinated.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p></div>

<p>Vaccination was introduced to China from the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
factory at Canton, and Sir George Staunton translated
into Chinese a tract on Cowpox, and had it printed at
Canton in 1805, the translator’s name and the foreign
origin of the practice being suppressed. Jenner, writing
to Dunning, 10th December, 1806, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Canton I have a most curious production&mdash;a pamphlet on
Vaccination in the Chinese language. Little did I think, my
friend, when our correspondence first began, that Heaven had in
store for me such abundant happiness. May I be grateful!</p></div>

<p>The Chinese had their own system of variolation,
namely, the use of pulverised smallpox scabs as snuff;
but some of them accepted vaccination, tried it, and
dropped it when they found it did not keep off the
disease as warranted. Smallpox in China is almost exclusively
a disease of childhood, and is little dreaded.
Dr. D. F. Rennie, medical officer to the British Embassy at
Peking in 1861-62, says of that city&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since 1820 vaccination (introduced from Canton) has been
practised to a limited extent among the population&mdash;probably one-fifth
may be vaccinated. At one time it was believed to afford
protection, Smallpox not having been so common immediately
after its introduction. Of recent years, however, confidence in it
has considerably diminished, owing to the frequency with which
those are attacked who have been vaccinated.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p></div>

<p>Persia was sometimes referred to in the ravings that
went on as to the triumphs of vaccination in the East;
but what was known of Persia? The practice was introduced
where Europeans were resident, but it never
became general. Dr. C. J. Willis has recently described
surgery and medicine in Persia as extremely rude and
superstitious, and that “vaccination is not in favour,
whilst inoculation, or the direct communication of the
disorder, by placing the patient in the same bed with one
suffering from smallpox of the most virulent type, is the
method pursued.”<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>It was natural enough for Jenner, in presence of
failure and contempt in England, to appeal to success in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the East, and to try to overwhelm his adversaries with
evidence which they could not overtake; but any one of
judicial temper must have perceived that if vaccination
was to be vindicated, data of a very different order would
have to be forthcoming. Where the number of the
population in a distant region was unknown, where the
ordinary prevalence of smallpox among the people was
undefined, where the extent of artificial variolation was
unspecified, and the existence and intensity of related
forms of zymotic disease were undescribed, what conclusion
could be drawn as to the efficacy of vaccination
that a man of science was bound to respect? Why
should certain knowledge in England be surrendered for
assertion from abroad.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">DIFFUSION OF VACCINATION THROUGHOUT EUROPE.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Vaccination was accepted as a revelation, and diffused
as a religion, and was almost everywhere received gladly.
We have to bear in mind, however, that the way had
been made straight for it by the practice of inoculation
with smallpox; which practice, after a struggle prolonged
over many years, had become an established part
of medical art, and was only limited in its application by
the inconvenience and risks that attended it. The promise
of the primitive vaccinators was, that the security
which resulted from inoculation with smallpox was to be
had from inoculation with cowpox, with absolute certainty,
absolute safety, and absolute permanence. The
argument was, that since no one could have smallpox
twice (however slight the attack), and as cowpox was a
mild form of smallpox, it sufficed to be inoculated with
cowpox to be safe from smallpox through life; and if
only the infliction of cowpox were made universal,
smallpox would be extirpated. Such was the plausible
doctrine; so plausible that it had only to be stated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
command assent; whilst so great was the elation over
the discovery (as much, perhaps, for deliverance from
inoculation with smallpox as from smallpox itself) that
it was accounted a sacred duty to diffuse its benefits over
the whole earth. Greater good on easier terms it was
difficult to imagine. With a scratch of a needle one of
the worst penalties attached to over-crowding, to filth,
and to ill-living, might be avoided and done away with
for ever.</p>

<p class="verse0">How pleasant are such sugared lies,</p>
<p class="verse0">Deceiving by their sweetness!</p>
</div></div>

<p>The first cowpox missionaries were Dr. Marshall and
Dr. Walker. £100 was teased out of the Admiralty, and
£100 out of the War Office toward their expenses, and
placed on board the <i>Endymion</i>, they proceeded, on 1st
July, 1800, to the Mediterranean. At Gibraltar, Minorca,
and Malta, they vaccinated soldiers and sailors, first
operating on orphans and foundlings to give the gallant
fellows courage. Then Walker accompanied Sir Ralph
Abercrombie to Egypt, from whence, after a variety of
adventures, he returned to London to serve as domestic
apostle, and vex Jenner for the remainder of his life.
Marshall proceeded to Sicily and Naples. In Palermo,
in the preceding year, 1799, there had been an epidemic,
in which, it was said, 8,000 had perished, and Marshall
appeared on the scene as a belated messenger of salvation.
At Naples he had a cordial reception from the wretched
Ferdinand IV. and his wretched court, who, with general
indifference or enmity to what was good, were ready to
show themselves gracious toward cowpox. Marshall
went through the customary performances of the variolous
test and the exposure of the vaccinated to infection; and
without further ado an hospital was opened, and all who
would be saved from smallpox were entreated to hasten
and receive the new inoculation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was not unusual [wrote Marshall to Jenner] to see in the
morning a procession of men, women, and children, conducted
through the streets by a priest carrying a cross, coming to the
hospital to be inoculated. By such popular means, the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
met with no opposition; and the common people expressed themselves
as certain that it was a blessing sent from Heaven, though
discovered by one heretic and practised by another.</p></div>

<p>When Marshall was at Gibraltar, Lord Keith issued
the following memorandum to the fleet&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">H.M. Ship <i>Foudroyant</i>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Gibraltar Bay</span>, <em>19th October, 1800</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>Any soldiers, seamen, or marines in the Fleet who may not have
had the Smallpox, and wish to avoid that dreadful malady, may,
by application to Dr. Marshall, on board the flag-ship, be inoculated
with the Cowpox, which, without pain or illness, or requiring
particular diet or state of body, or leaving any marks, effectually
excludes all possibility of the patient ever being affected with the
Smallpox.</p>

<p>
By command of the Vice-Admiral, <span class="smcap pad4">Philip Beaver</span>.<br />
<span class="pad4">To the respective Captains of the Fleet.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>I may observe, in passing, that there was little delay
in introducing vaccination to the British navy. Sir
Gilbert Blane was urgent, Earl Spencer, first Lord of
the Admiralty, acquiescent, and Dr. Trotter, physician to
the fleet, enthusiastic. So early as 9th December, 1800,
Trotter was prophesying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Jennerian Inoculation will be deservedly recorded as one
of the greatest blessings to the navy of Great Britain that ever
was extended to it.</p></div>

<p>Smallpox was one of the pests of the service. Trotter,
writing 20th February, 1801, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Within the past seven years there have been more than a
hundred instances in which the seamen have been infected;
twenty having occurred in the last six months in the Channel
fleet alone.</p></div>

<p>These outbreaks were invariably referred to an origin
external to the ship; as if anywhere smallpox could have
had a more congenial breeding-place than the crew of a
man-of-war! As Dr. Johnson observed, “When you
look down from the quarter-deck to the space below, you
see the utmost extremity of human misery; such crowding,
such filth, such stench!”<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Incited by the enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Trotter, the medical officers of the Fleet subscribed
for a gold medal, and presented it to Jenner. On the
obverse, Apollo was represented introducing a young seaman
recovered from cowpox to Britannia, who, in return,
extended a civic crown, on which was inscribed <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>;
above were the words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alba nautis stella refulsit</i>, and
below the date, 1801. On the reverse was an anchor
and over it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Georgio Tertio Rege</i>, and under it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spencer
Duces</i>. The medal was presented to Jenner in February,
1801.</p>

<p>The dates are worth noting afresh. Jenner’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>
was published in the summer of 1798; and thus we see
that within three years his prescription for the prevention
and extermination of smallpox was adopted in a
branch of the public service where obstinate conservatism
was the ruling temper; and an assertion that only time
could test was accepted without hesitation as verified and
certain. If vaccination had answered to the claim made
for it, the haste wherewith it was acknowledged would
have been unjustifiable, and wholly unlike the struggle
that truth has commonly to pass through in order to
obtain supremacy in the intellect and practice of mankind.</p>

<p>The first attempts to inoculate with cowpox in France
proving futile, Dr. Woodville went over to Paris in 1800
to show in practice the method of operation. He had a
warm reception, and the Quaker was overwhelmed with
the exuberant attentions to which he was subjected. In
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur</cite> he was described as “a learned man, animated
with generous zeal, and worthy of gratitude and
praise;” who had inoculated six thousand children with
invariable success; and that cowpox as a preventive of
smallpox could only be spoken of as something miraculous.
A house was opened as a vaccine station, and men,
women, and children, flocked thither to receive the benign
fluid and life-long protection from a dreadful malady.</p>

<p>When the negotiations for the peace of Amiens were in
progress, 1802, an address was presented with much
pomp to the Marquis Cornwallis by the Medical Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of the Somme, claiming brotherhood with the
physicians of England, eulogising Jenner, denouncing his
detractors, stigmatising variolators as acting neither from
the love of truth nor for the glory of their profession,
but, from avarice and hatred of improvement; whilst, as
the result of numerous experiments, “the discovery made
in England had been stamped with the seal of infallibility
in France.”</p>

<p>At first, vaccination in France was left to voluntary
effort, and made little progress in face of a strenuous
resistance developed by alarmed variolators; but a severe
smallpox epidemic in 1802 incited the Government to
action. A medical commission was appointed to investigate
and report, and in 1804 it was determined to spare
no effort to extend vaccination over the whole of France.
A Central Committee for Vaccination was constituted,
and appeals and commands were addressed to the clergy
and officials of all orders to have those under their
authority and influence inoculated with cowpox. Some
préfects were content to recommend and warn, but others
adopted more vigorous measures, such as the exclusion of
the unvaccinated from schools, from employment, from
charities&mdash;in short, anticipating much legislation that has
come into force, or that fanatics wish to bring into force.
Nevertheless, the progress made did not satisfy Napoleon,
and seeing that until vaccination was everywhere paid
for by the State, its performance must remain irregular
and perfunctory, a manifesto was issued to the effect that
his Majesty the Emperor and King had learned from the
reports of the Central Committee that the preservation
and increase of his vast dominions were immediately related
to systematic and universal vaccination; wherefore,
his Majesty, wishing to give a signal mark of his paternal
solicitude for his subjects, had granted to his Excellency
the Minister of the Interior, an annual special credit,
destined to provide for the expenses necessary for extending
the new practice, and for forming centres of issue
of vaccine virus in twenty-four of the chief cities of the
Empire&mdash;these, then, including Brussels, Florence, Parma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
and Turin. And his Majesty had also, out of his paternal
benevolence, provided annual prizes as incentives to
emulation in propagating vaccination, so that the scourge
of smallpox might be completely banished from his territories.</p>

<p>It would be idle to speculate as to how much serious
faith lay within this apparent zeal for vaccination; for,
as Professor Seeley observes, “Napoleon seemed to care
for no opinion, though he adopted, with studied artificial
vehemence, every fashionable opinion in turn.” There
might be, I dare say, something piquant to his theatrical
genius in opposing his odious contempt for human life to
the rigorous enforcement of what was considered a supreme
prescription for its preservation. Jenner availed himself
of the Emperor’s histrionic instinct in soliciting the release
of English travellers detained in France. To one of
these occasions we owe the artless anecdote of the arrest
of Napoleon’s refusal by the interposition of Josephine,
who exclaimed, “Jenner!” The Emperor paused and
said, “Jenner! ah, we can deny nothing to that man!”
It is sad to relate, the favour was not reciprocated.
When Jenner, at the suggestion of Baron Corvisart,
appealed to the British Government for similar indulgence
to a Frenchman, he had to report that there
was no charm in his intervention among his countrymen.</p>

<p>That vaccination should have a welcome in Spain was
not surprising, after its reception in Naples. The craze
was universal, and diffused through the lowest intelligences.
Cowpox was introduced to Madrid with the
certificate of France under that of England; and, spite of
the distractions of the time, excited much attention.
Mr. Allen, secretary to Lord Holland, writing to Jenner
from Madrid in 1803, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no country likely to receive more benefit from your
labours than Spain; for, on the one hand, the mortality among
children from the Smallpox has always been very great; and, on
the other hand, the inoculation for the Cowpox has been received
with the same enthusiasm here as in the rest of Europe; though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
am sorry to add that the inoculation of the spurious sort has proved
fatal to many children at Seville, who have fallen victims to the
Smallpox after they had been pronounced secure from that disease.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p></div>

<p>There were philosophising doctors in Madrid who did
not see why cowpox should possess a singular efficacy,
and induced the King, in 1804, to order that all the
children in the foundling hospital should be inoculated
with goatpox. They did not, perhaps, know that Jenner
had inoculated his son with swinepox, and that the child
underwent the variolous test on several occasions with
impunity.</p>

<p>The great event in connection with Spain was the
expedition of Dr. Francis Xavier Balmis, physician to his
Catholic Majesty. He obtained a concession to introduce
vaccination to the colonies in America and Asia, and to
defray expenses by freely trading in merchandise. He
sailed from Corunna, 30th November, 1803, with twenty-two
children for the propagation of virus. The Canary
Islands were first visited, then Porto Rico, and at Caracas
the party divided, Don Francis Salvani proceeding to
Peru and Chili, whilst Balmis attended to Cuba and
Mexico, crossing the Pacific to the Philippines with
twenty-six children to maintain the succession of the
virus, and proceeding from thence to Macao and Canton.
Having circumnavigated the globe as vaccinator and
trader, Balmis re-appeared in Madrid with great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>,
and kissed the King’s hand on 7th September, 1806.
Philanthropy and business were successfully combined,
for as Moore, writing in 1817, observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nearly three years were nobly spent by this excellent man in
putting a Vaccine Girdle round the globe; and it is an additional
pleasure to learn that by trading during his circumnavigation, he
acquired an easy fortune. He now enjoys at Madrid the distinction
he has merited, and patronises the diffusion of Vaccination through
the Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>The expedition of Balmis naturally excited much attention,
and its progress and results were described in
terms of inflated rhetoric. Thus, we read in Baron’s <cite>Life
of Jenner</cite>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The conductors of the expedition were <em>everywhere</em> welcomed
with the <em>utmost enthusiasm</em>. It was to be expected that the
representatives of the Spanish Monarch, and all the constituted
authorities, would gladly co-operate; but it was scarcely to be
anticipated that the unenlightened minds of the Indians would so
soon appreciate the value of the mission. It is, nevertheless, most
gratifying to know that the numerous hordes which occupy the
immense tract of country between the United States and the
Spanish colonies <em>all</em> received the precious fluid with <em>the utmost
readiness</em>. They acquired the art of vaccinating, and soon performed
the operation with great dexterity.</p></div>

<p>Thus not only the Spanish Americans were brought
under the dominion of cowpox, but the Indians, yea, <em>all</em>
the Indians; and not reluctantly, but joyfully, and
became experts in the practice of the rite! Baron continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fame had preceded the arrival of Salvani at Santa Fé. On
approaching the capital, he was met by the Viceroy, the Archbishop,
and all the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. The event
was celebrated with religious pomp and ceremonies; and in a
short time more than fifty thousand persons were vaccinated.
Similar honours awaited the expedition <em>throughout its whole
course</em>. At Quito they were greeted with boundless joy and
festivity. Such expressions well became them. The people of
Colombia, the Indians more especially, having been often scourged
by the horrid ravages of Smallpox, regarded it as the most terrible
affliction which Heaven could send them. On its first appearance
in a village, a panic seized every heart; each family prepared an
isolated hovel, to which those who were supposed to be infected
were banished. <em>There</em>, without succour, without remedy, and with
a very insufficient supply of food, they were exposed to the alternations
of a very variable climate, and left to their fate. <em>In this
way whole generations perished.</em> Under Viceroy Toledo the population
of the native Indians had amounted to 7,500,000; but at the
time of the Balmis expedition, the number was supposed to be
reduced to one-fifth&mdash;that is 1,500,000.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p></div>

<p>Indian and savage statistics in connection with smallpox
and vaccination are usually little else than exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
in imaginative desire&mdash;less what is true than what is
wished to be true, or to be taken for true. We know
the difficulty of vaccinating populations dwelling within
defined limits and under highly organised governments,
and we can therefore estimate the claims made for Balmis
and his partners as roving traders and quacks in the
territories occupied by Spaniards and Indians. Yet it
was with yards of mythical rubbish of this sort that
English vaccinators tried to divert the attention of their
countrymen from the failures of vaccination within their
own experience; and when worried with ever-recurring
disasters at home, it was in turning to Mexico and Peru
that Jenner professed to find consolation.</p>

<p>Dr. Sacco, of Milan, was described as “the apostle of
vaccination in Northern Italy,” and “unquestionably the
greatest vaccinator in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> His operations received
the sanction of the Napoleonic administration, and
as early as 1801 he was appointed Director of Vaccination
to the Cisalpine Republic. “Strong measures,”
writes Moore, “were adopted; proclamations were read
from every pulpit; vaccination was practised in every
church; and the clergy gave such effectual aid, that the
Professor and his associates in three years vaccinated
70,000 persons, and extinguished smallpox in Lombardy.”<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
In other words, the vaccination of 70,000 persons extinguished
smallpox in a population of several millions!
Baron enlarges the numbers, saying that Dr. Sacco and
his assistants in the course of eight years vaccinated
1,300,000 persons; and cites a letter from Sacco, dated
from Trieste, 5th January, 1808, with the following extraordinary
statement&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During eight years I reckon more than 600,000 vaccinated by
my own hand, and more than 700,000 by my deputies in the
different departments of the kingdom. I assure you, out of a
population of 6,000,000 to have vaccinated 1,300,000 is something
to boast of; and I flatter myself that in Italy I have been the
means of promoting Vaccination in a degree which no other kingdom
of the same population has equalled.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Moore’s 70,000 is a credible number, whatever may be
thought of its vicarious operation; but Sacco’s 600,000
by his own hand in eight years! Ah, well! when we are
lost in the fabulous, it is unnecessary to waste our
strength in the discrimination of the greater from the less
in falsehood. Nevertheless, taking Sacco’s figures, we
have to observe that the vaccination of 1,300,000 saved
6,000,000 from smallpox. That Italy was freed from
smallpox is true, and the exemption of the population,
whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, was prolonged over
nearly thirty years. The disappearance of the disease
had, however, set in before vaccination was heard of, but
the subsidence was claimed for Sacco, although it extended
to millions of Italians who owed nothing to the
new prophylactic. As already observed, from some cause
undefined, the area and intensity of smallpox was signally
diminishing toward the close of last century, and this in
spite of the stimulus applied to the disease by variolous
inoculation. It may have been so stimulated as to have
been worked out&mdash;forced, as it were, to exhaustion, after
the habit of much else, good and bad, when developed to
the extremity of existence.</p>

<p>As a grand vaccinator Dr. De Carro, of Vienna, was
scarcely less distinguished than Sacco. He was a Swiss
from Geneva, who had studied and graduated at Edinburgh,
and settled in Vienna. He performed the first
vaccination on the Continent, in 1799, with virus
conveyed on a couple of threads from Dr. Pearson; and
in 1802 he succeeded in transmitting the first effective
virus to India. De Carro conducted his operations with
great energy and tact, and in 1802 he induced the
Austrian Government to issue an ordinance conferring
on vaccination Imperial sanction and recommendation.
Concurrently with this activity, smallpox was abating,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc</i> was converted into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter hoc</i>. De Carro
was credited with the extinction of smallpox in Vienna;
but as no more than a portion of the citizens had been
vaccinated, Vienna thus supplied another instance of the
vicarious influence of the Jennerian rite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>Sacco and De Carro corresponded with Jenner, and it
is worth noting that both concurred with him in the
opinion that cowpox originated in horsegrease; and,
further, that horsegrease was as good against smallpox
as horsegrease cowpox itself. Indeed, Sacco set up a
stock of virus derived from horsegrease, operated with
it, and supplied De Carro, who used it so freely in Vienna
that, as he said, he could not tell the vaccinated from
the equinated. Writing to Jenner, on 21st June, 1803,
De Carro observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The means of making your discovery were everywhere; yet
nobody before you had the least idea of the singular connection
between the Horsegrease, the Cowpox, and the Smallpox.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p></div>

<p>The favour shown for vaccination by the English
Court facilitated its adoption throughout Germany; and
yet it might be said the craze went of itself, compelling
patronage and exacting advocacy. The King of Prussia
opened a Royal Inoculation Institute in Berlin, and
tracts and medals, speeches and sermons, were brought
into requisition to recommend the new rite. From the
furore created, many were led to believe that all Prussia
was vaccinated, and as smallpox ceased to prevail, cowpox
had the credit. To vaccinate a nation, however, is
far from easily accomplished, and when we refer to the
official accounts, we discover that, notwithstanding great
ado, the numbers operated upon constituted less than a
tithe of the people. Jenner cites a report of Professor
Avelin, of Berlin, in a letter to Moore, 15th February,
1812, as authority for these statistics&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The anniversary of the invention of the Cowpox Inoculation, or
the Jennerian Feast, was celebrated very solemnly at Berlin on
14th May. By public accounts, it appears that there were inoculated
in all the Prussian States&mdash;</p>

<p>At these times the population was about 9,743,000. From 1806<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
to 1810 (since the horrible war and the diminution of the population
to 4,338,000) the inoculated were 160,329. Dr. Bremer alone at
the Royal Institute in Berlin inoculated 14,605. The total, as
officially and voluntarily sent to the Government, amounted to
402,720 vaccinated, but certainly one-half was not officially mentioned.
It may certainly be at least 600,000, or even 800,000.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p></div>

<p>Supposing a million had been vaccinated in Prussia in
the course of ten years, let me ask once more, how could
they have saved the remaining millions from smallpox?
Yet, with knowledge of these figures, Moore, the Director
of the National Vaccine Establishment in London, did
not hesitate to write&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The King of Prussia directed his children to be vaccinated, and
also issued orders that Vaccination should be immediately employed
in the Army; and the new practice encountered no further difficulties.
By which, and by the total abandonment of Variolous
Inoculation throughout Germany, the Smallpox rapidly declined;
and in a few years was extinguished in some of the largest cities,
from whose purlieus infectious diseases are expelled with great
difficulty. Thus even in Vienna, where full four hundred persons
had annually been destroyed by the Smallpox, this mortality
diminished rapidly after the introduction of the Vaccine, and in five
years absolutely ceased.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p></div>

<p>Russia, of course, followed suit in cowpox inoculation.
At the coronation of Alexander in Moscow in 1801 a
foundling was operated on, christened Vaccinoff, pensioned
for life, and dispatched to St. Petersburg to serve
as a source of virus for other foundlings. Then followed
imperial decrees prescribing vaccination, and Dr. Crichton
was directed to organise a medical staff for the performance
of the rite in each province of the Empire. In 1811
a ukase was issued commanding all Russians to be vaccinated
within three years. As measuring the possibilities
of despotism in such a matter, we learn from Dr.
Crichton that between 1804 and 1812 there were 1,235,597
vaccinations performed in Russia&mdash;a similar number to
that which Sacco professed to have accomplished in
Northern Italy in the same time. It was estimated in
Russia that of every seven children born, one perished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
of smallpox, and therefore Crichton argued the lives of
176,514 had (up to 1812) been saved by vaccination.
The calculation illustrates the facility with which the
early vaccinators deceived themselves&mdash;first, as to the
certainty of their prophylactic; second, as to its vicarious
efficacy; and, third, in assuming that a reduction in
smallpox represented a reduction in mortality.</p>

<p>From Crichton, too, we learn that there were anti-vaccinists
in Russia in those days&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding the supreme order of His Imperial Majesty,
that all his subjects he vaccinated within three years, we find that,
powerful as his Majesty is, this cannot be executed. There is a
power greater than sovereignty, namely, the conscience of religious
opinions of men, and in one or two of the distant governments
there exists a peculiar religious sect belonging to the Greek Church,
who esteem it a damnable crime to encourage the propagation of
any disease, or to employ any doctors, or to swallow any medicines
under the visitations of God. Reason has been employed in vain
with these poor people; they have been threatened with severe
punishments in case they remain refractory, but all to no purpose.
You may well imagine that no punishment has been resorted to,
though threatened, and the Government has come to the wise
conclusion of leaving the dispute to time.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p></div>

<p>To complete this rapid survey of the diffusion of vaccination
throughout Europe, there remain Sweden with
Finland, and Denmark with Iceland; but as the case of
Sweden is specially interesting and instructive from the
fulness and precision of its vital statistics, coupled with
the claim made by vaccinators that Sweden affords
irrefutable evidence of the efficacy of their prescription,
I reserve it for a special chapter. There is nothing
pleasanter than finding the strongholds of one’s antagonists,
capturing, and occupying them.</p>

<p class="noindent">Jenner was in the habit of pointing to Sweden and
Ceylon as proofs of what vaccination might accomplish.
We have seen how badly Ceylon answered to his reference;
and I now proceed to inquire whether Sweden
served his purpose any better.</p>

<p>The decline of smallpox in some communities, contemporaneously
with the introduction of vaccination, might
be ascribed to the cessation of inoculation with smallpox&mdash;virtually
the culture of that disease; but in Sweden
little had to be accounted for in that way. Spite of
strong recommendations, variolation was rarely practised,
and never became popular. The very year that vaccination
was introduced, Dr. Acksell, of Kalmer, stated in an
official report, dated 30th March, 1801, “that it is impossible
to convince the lower classes of the advantages of
inoculation. Dr. Colliander and I have had it announced
to the people from the pulpit, that, we were ready to
give our services, gratis, in inoculating their children, but
not a single person applied.” And such undoubtedly was
the state of things throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>Sweden last century was sorely afflicted with smallpox,
and, considering the repute of variolation in other lands,
it is surprising how the people refrained from its vaunted
protection. It is thought dreadful that in London one
death in ten should have been due to this disease, but in
Sweden the ratio stood as high as one in seven. To give
some idea of the extent of the mischief at its highest and
its lowest, let us look at eighteen years in the latter half
of the century&mdash;</p>

<p>In these figures we see how wide were the variations
in smallpox mortality prior to the introduction of vaccination;
and also how indifferent was its influence on the
general mortality, much smallpox not raising the death-rate,
nor little smallpox lowering it.</p>

<p>Among the factors of mortality in Sweden were
scarcity and famine. At this day, when the ends of the
earth are drawn together, we are apt to forget the struggle,
the misery, and the sickness that prevailed when a deficient
harvest in one country, or parts of the same country,
could not be made good from the sufficiency of others.
Population in Northern Europe did little more than
maintain existence through several centuries against the
severity of Nature, with food scant and bad, and raiment
and shelter inadequate. Of the latter fifty years of last
century, at least fifteen were years of dearth in Sweden,
and consequently of increased mortality.</p>

<p>The chief sufferers from deficient and unsuitable food
are the young, their suffering having form in various ailments,
and among them smallpox. I have repeatedly had
to point out how smallpox is especially an affection of
childhood, and how in Scotland, for instance, it used to
be almost exclusively confined to the young, like measles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
and whooping-cough. The like was true of Sweden; for
of the deaths from smallpox from <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '1774 to 1708'">1774 to 1798</ins>&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>

<p>Now, whilst I have no wish to minimise the sadness
and culpability of the mortality of the young, I have yet
to maintain that its consequences are by no means so
serious to the State as when the heads of families and
bread-winners are stricken down; and that it is a gross
exaggeration to compare the fatality of smallpox with
that of men slain in battle. Again, we have to recollect
how many of the young die from smallpox, so to say,
needlessly, from inattention and malpractice. This was
clearly recognised in a Royal Letter issued from Stockholm
in 1763, recommending variolation, in which the
Medical Board was directed “to instruct the common
people how children should be treated when suffering
from natural smallpox,” assigning the cogent reason,
“because many more children die from want of care than
from the disease.” The assertion may be taken as indisputable;
and, being true, it stands for the fact that the
mortality from smallpox might have been largely reduced
if parents had had the knowledge and the means
to nurse their offspring through their illness. They died
less of smallpox than of ignorant and defective treatment
whilst under smallpox.</p>

<p>I have also to observe that smallpox in Sweden was
steadily declining toward the close of the century, and
that the decline continued into the present century.
Taking the years in decades from 1749 to 1868, and
casting the average, we have these results&mdash;</p>

<p>With these details before us, we are in a position to
appreciate the claim made for vaccination, that it exterminated
Smallpox in Sweden.</p>

<p>Vaccination began to be practised in Sweden in the
year 1801. It was at first viewed with distrust by some
of the leading medical authorities, but grew so rapidly in
favour, that the medical board in 1803 ventured to make
proposals for its general introduction. By Royal Letters
in 1804 and 1805 measures were decreed for the encouragement
of Vaccination; and in the almanacs for
1806, information and advice were inserted concerning
“the new and certain means for the prevention and extirpation
of Smallpox.” Nevertheless, the practice made
way but slowly into the confidence of the common people,
and not until 1812 did a committee of the Diet go so far
as to recommend its compulsory adoption. The principle
of compulsion was affirmed by the Diet in 1815, leading
to a Royal Decree of 6th March, 1816, whereby Vaccination
was made obligatory under penalty of fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the law was modified, but never relaxed.
Whilst the rite was obligatory, it was offered gratuitously,
and public vaccinators, usually parish clerks and midwives,
were appointed throughout the land, and stimulated
to exertion by special rewards. Vaccination was made a
condition of admission to school, and was placed by the
clergy on a level with baptism and confirmation. Wherefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
in course of time, it has come to pass that Sweden
is described as “the best vaccinated country in the world.”</p>

<p>To this result the recognised interest of the Swedish
clergy in medical practice largely contributed. They
were not slow to perceive a fresh line of business in vaccination.
Archbishop Lindblom, among others, was extremely
zealous in promoting the practice in his diocese,
and from a correspondence between the Consistory of
Upsala and the Medical Board, it appears that the competition
between the physicians and the parsons was
severe. The Consistory complained that the rewards for
vaccination energy were more liberally bestowed on
medical men than on the deserving clergy, and that it
was unfair to insist on the clergy taking out a license to
vaccinate, ending with the reproach that the mishaps of
some medical men had so alarmed the people in certain
districts, that very few were willing to avail themselves
of the wonderful prophylactic. The Board replied, that
they were aware that mistakes had occurred through the
use of spurious cowpox, as proved by the outbreak of
smallpox afterwards; but, at the same time, what better
check could be devised on incompetent practitioners than
a medical license? The right of the clergy to vaccinate
was not contested, but only that they should possess some
recognised qualification. The extent of the ecclesiastical
operations in cowpox appears from the return of the
Archbishopric of Upsala, which showed that from 1804
to the end of 1810 there were 33,298 persons vaccinated,
of whom 7,025 were inoculated by clergy, 20,000 by
church officers, and 6,273 by medical men and others. It
was by the clergy and the doctors that the project of
compulsion was initiated. In a letter from the Medical
Board to the King in 1810, complaint was made that
“the public in Sweden do not in all places manifest the
care and zeal which might be expected from sensible and
tender parents in applying for, or allowing to be applied,
the precious means of salvation provided for their
children’s good looks and future health.” In 1814, the
same Board wrote that “several of the Bishops who take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the deepest interest in the spread of vaccination, have expressed
their conviction that certain well-devised penalties
have become as necessary as regards the ignorant masses
as encouragements are useful”; and as late as 1815, the
Board had to testify against the “sluggishness and indifference
prevalent among the less enlightened classes.”</p>

<p>Compulsion was, therefore, enacted in 1816 to overcome
the inertia of the lower orders, the mass of the
people who at all times yield the largest crop of smallpox.</p>

<p>“Smallpox was exterminated in Sweden by vaccination,”
is a common saying. Moore, in his <cite>History of
Vaccination</cite>, published in 1817, after describing the
various measures taken, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is superfluous to add, that by such a concurrence of virtuous
exertions, Smallpox was quickly suppressed in Sweden.</p></div>

<p>Ere proceeding to inquire whether smallpox was thus
suppressed, I would call attention to the hands by which
vaccination was administered in Sweden. It is the
custom at this day to describe vaccination as a delicate
operation, and to attribute subsequent smallpox to some
irregularity or defect in its performance; and yet here
we are asked to contemplate a whole nation delivered
from smallpox, the vaccinators being chiefly priests,
clerks, and midwives. What does it mean? Is it that
any sort of vaccination is good when smallpox does not
follow, and that any sort is bad when smallpox does
follow? If smallpox had not ceased out of the land,
would it then have been said, “What wonder, considering
the character of the vaccinators”?</p>

<p>To the assertion that smallpox in Sweden was exterminated
by vaccination, the answer is an unqualified contradiction.
It is not true; it is demonstrably untrue.
Smallpox was declining in Sweden before vaccination
was heard of, and the fall continued irrespective of its
influence. Look at the figures. Here we have the returns
of smallpox mortality in Sweden during the last
sixteen years of the past, and the first sixteen years of
the current century, up to the time when vaccination was
made compulsory&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus we see the process of subsidence, with alternations
from year to year, with the reduction of two-thirds, from
66,866 in the former to 23,376 in the latter series of years.</p>

<p>It will be said, of course, that vaccination was introduced
into Sweden in 1801. True, but the introduction
of vaccination was one thing, and its diffusion over the
nation another. It was a section of the people least
likely to be affected with smallpox who welcomed and
practised vaccination; and however energetic and successful
they might be in their promotion of the new rite,
their efforts were limited to thousands among millions.
All the while smallpox was declining, and they took the
decline for encouragement, and began to cry out, “See!
see what we are doing!” The enactment of compulsory
and gratuitous vaccination in 1816 was an open confession
that the lower classes remained to be dealt with, that is
to say, the very people among whom smallpox had its
stronghold. There are tribes whose priests profess to
bring rain, and drive away sickness with their enchantments;
but if showers had begun to descend, and the sick
to recover, ere their assistance was invoked, it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
hard to convince even the credulous that the desired
relief was due to their subsequent magic. But it is
precisely in the subsequent magic of the vaccinators that
we are asked to believe when told that vaccination drove
smallpox out of Sweden. It was going out before vaccination
was called in, and kept going out all the same
when the vaccinators plied their enchantments. Happily,
patient Nature holds her way unprovoked by human
quackeries. Not even to confute impostors does she
reverse for an instant her impartial operations.</p>

<p>But, although deaths from smallpox fell off so rapidly,
there was no correspondent improvement in the public
health. Smallpox was merely replaced by other forms
of disease. Thus, the death-rate of Sweden per 1,000 for
seventy years, stands as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>We therefore see that while Jenner and his friends
were boasting of their achievements in Sweden, they had
to account for the fall in smallpox before their intervention,
and for its continued decline ere their intervention
was operative; and, moreover, to answer the question,
What is the profit of salvation from smallpox if death
ensue from other causes? It is, however, to be observed
that such large considerations were outside the scope of
Jenner’s intelligence. <em>There was</em> smallpox, and <em>there was</em>
vaccination, <em>his</em> invention, the infallible preventive of
smallpox, and he saw nothing beyond. His self-love was
implicated in the defence of vaccination, and any story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
in its favour was accepted as true, and proclaimed abroad,
whilst anything to its discredit was resented as a personal
affront, or denounced as wilful and diabolic falsehood. As
for statistics, he had no capacity. Baron says, “Neither
Dr. Jenner’s previous education nor his habits gave him a
relish for any of the branches of pure science; and he
seemed to have a peculiar horror of arithmetical questions,
and was often jocular on this defect in his nature.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
This inability to calculate goes far to account for the
absurdity of many of his statements concerning the
miraculous effects of vaccination among populations where
only two or three per cent. had been operated upon; and
who, therefore, must have vicariously delivered the remainder
from smallpox. To an intellect thus defective,
the introduction of vaccination to Sweden was the vaccination
of the Swedes; the decline of smallpox was its
suppression; and its suppression was the consequence of
vaccination. But the excuse that is available for Jenner
does not serve those who cannot plead his congenital defect,
and are satisfied to repeat his preposterous assertions.</p>

<p>Smallpox kept declining in Sweden until the decade
(1841-50) when the annual average of deaths per million
fell to 212. The variations in the mortality in single
years are remarkable. Here are thirteen years when the
deaths were under a hundred&mdash;</p>

<p>The death-rate from smallpox, which fell to 212 per
million in 1841-50, rose to 862 per million in 1851-60, to
867 per million in 1861-70, and, owing to the epidemic
of 1873-74, the worst in Sweden since 1801, the last
decade, 1871-80, will exhibit a higher average.</p>

<p>In presence of these statistics, it is fair to repeat the
inquiry, “Why was smallpox declining before vaccination
was introduced; and why has smallpox revived and increased
in ‘the best vaccinated country in Europe’?”</p>

<p>Again, too, I must call attention afresh to the fact of
the irrelevant influence of smallpox upon the national
mortality. Mr. P. A. Siljeström has published a diagram
of the course of mortality in Sweden from 1774 to 1878,
with the part smallpox has played in that mortality, from
which it is manifest (to all who choose to use their own
eyes) that the action of smallpox as a destroyer of life
has been wildly exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Bad years of smallpox
are not years of a high death-rate, nor are years with
little smallpox years of a low death-rate. When smallpox
is prevalent it appears to replace other forms of disease,
and when not prevalent, to be replaced by diseases
of greater fatality. Wherefore, argues Mr. Siljeström&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of what use is it to the public that a smaller number of citizens
die annually from Smallpox (supposing that this result is brought
about by Vaccination), if an equally large number, nevertheless,
die from other diseases? We can see no farther advantage in it
than there would be in a battle, if none of the men fell before the
fire of the artillery, but all the more died from the fire of the line.
To the individual it may possibly be more agreeable to die of any
other disease than Smallpox, and it ought, therefore, to be allowed
to everyone to save himself, through Vaccination, or any other
lawful means, from an eventuality which he fears; but this cannot
possibly, in itself, be regarded as the business of the State.</p></div>

<p>Sweden is a large country, and its diseases must be
subject to many local variations; but Stockholm, representing
a compact population, exhibits much the same
phenomena. In some years of last century the city was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
severely afflicted with smallpox, as the deaths in these
years show&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">And then came the dreadful epidemic of 1874, when
1,191 perished, and 317 in 1875.</p>

<p>Thus, in two years, 1,382 perished in a population of
150,000&mdash;a death-rate of 7,916 per million&mdash;against 2,430
per million in London during the memorable epidemic
of 1871; the severest outbreak of smallpox in the century
in “the best and most vaccinated population in Europe!”</p>

<p>Under examination, the case for vaccination in Sweden
altogether disappears. By Mr. P. A. Siljeström the examination
has been conducted with a precision, a thoroughness,
and a judicial temper that leave nothing to desire.
His treatise was translated into English by Miss Frederica
Rowan, and published in 1875, under the title of “The
Vaccination Question: an Essay towards determining the
Boundaries within which a Scientific Theory may rightfully
claim to have effect given it by Legislation;” and a
skilful abridgment was produced by Prof. F. W. Newman;
but the original, which extends to no more than 104
pages, should be studied by whoever is seriously interested
in the vaccination question. Sweden, through
the possession of a long series of vital statistics, offers
special facilities for a comprehensive study of the phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
of smallpox; and in Mr. Siljeström’s treatise,
we have veracity with good sense, and science with
philosophy, instead of the inadequate and catchpenny
stuff current in this country as “truth about vaccination.”</p>

<p>In Finland, the story of vaccination is much the same
as in Sweden, with the difference that there was no
natural subsidence of smallpox to be placed to its credit.
Wherefore, as concerns Finland, it is the habit of vaccinators
to preserve a discreet silence, the facts not tending
to edification in the Jennerian faith.</p>

<p>A curious evidence of the simple trust with which the
cowpox revelation was received in certain countries, is
found in an ordinance issued in Finland constituting
smallpox after vaccination a proof of imposture on the
part of the vaccinator. The ordinance ran thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the Inoculator or Vaccinator whose patients, within a
shorter or longer time after having by him been inoculated or
vaccinated, shall prove to have been attacked by natural Smallpox,
with deadly result or other serious consequence, shall without
pardon be declared unworthy of all further right to reward or
confidence, and moreover, be impeached for due punishment on
account of dishonest and unprofessional behaviour.</p></div>

<p>Under such a law (no severer than many which enact
punishment where the buyer does not obtain from the
seller what he gives his money for) how would it fare
with the legion who now practise vaccination? But I
am reminded that vaccinators no longer undertake to
preserve their patients from smallpox, but only to keep
it off until it comes, and then to make it milder.</p>

<p>Vaccination was introduced to Denmark at the same
time as Sweden, and was made compulsory in 1810. As
in Sweden, smallpox was falling off, and, as in Sweden,
the vaccinators were loud in their outcry over their
success; but their claim was absurd. The population of
Denmark in 1801 was 925,680, and up to 1810 no more
than 118,782 persons had been vaccinated, whilst the
births during the same period were 283,905. It was,
therefore, assumed that the vaccination of less than a
tenth of the population in eight years had reduced and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
extinguished smallpox among the unvaccinated nine-tenths!
Where there is a disposition to believe, anything
may pass for credible.</p>

<p>Subsequently to 1801 there was little smallpox in
Copenhagen, and from 1811 to 1823 not a death from the
disease was recorded; but in 1824 smallpox reappeared;
and in 1835 there were 434 deaths in the city; when it
began to be admitted that vaccination did not prevent
smallpox, and that revaccination was necessary for complete
protection; but, if requisite, how was the miraculous
extinction of the disease by the primary vaccination of
less than a tenth of the population in the early years of
the century to be accounted for?</p>

<p>Here we have the record of Copenhagen smallpox for
seventy-five years, 1801-75&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">

<p>Thus the number of deaths in the five years, 1871-75,
was nearly equal to the deaths in the preceding thirty
years, 1841-70; whilst at the same time the more or less
smallpox had no apparent influence in raising or lowering
the general mortality.</p>

<p>Iceland, as a dependency of Denmark, is often cited as
evidence for the virtue of vaccination. Speaking in the
House of Commons recently, Mr. T. W. Evans proclaimed,
“Vaccination has extinguished smallpox in Iceland!
There has not been a case in the island for thirty years.”
Could aught be more conclusive? and the assertion is
re-asserted with triumph: yet, under examination, we
shall see the statement and the inference vanish like
smoke.</p>

<p>First, the absence of smallpox from Iceland for series
of years was nothing uncommon. Iceland’s history is
singularly copious and accurate; and from Schleisner’s

<p>Inasmuch then as vaccination could have nothing to
do with the years of immunity in former times, on what
ground of reason can vaccination be set forth as the
cause of immunity at this day? Schleisner observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since 1306 Smallpox has been epidemic in Iceland nineteen
times, and has always been brought in either by French, English,
Dutch, or Danish ships. In early times it frequently caused a
terrible mortality, as in 1707, when 18,000 out of a population of
50,000 perished; and in 1430, when 8000 are said to have died. In
later years its violence has diminished <em>in consequence of the
introduction of Vaccination</em>. In 1785-6-7, its last attack in the
eighteenth century, only 1425 persons died.</p></div>

<p>Very good; but in 1785-87, vaccination was unknown;
and as the epidemics of 1742 and 1762 are recorded by
Schleisner as “small” and “mild” respectively, while so
early as 1580 one is described as “a kind of variolous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
disease,” it is evident that vaccination could have as little
to do with making “smallpox milder” as with the long
terms of immunity which Iceland has enjoyed.</p>

<p>In an appeal by Mr. William Morris on behalf of the
Icelanders, threatened with famine in 1882 he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lastly, the Measles, which has not been in Iceland for thirty-six
years, and which falling on a people not used to it, is a deadly and
not a trivial disease, has attacked Reykjavik, where half the people
are down with it, and many have died, and it is now spreading
over the island.</p></div>

<p>Measles absent from Iceland for thirty-six years!
Supposing there were some dodge against measles corresponding
to vaccination against smallpox, would not the
exemption in every year up to the thirty-sixth have
been ascribed to its efficacy?</p>

<p>Dr. Garth Wilkinson relates that in 1866 when standing
on the Lawrock, where the Althing was held, Dr.
Hjaltalin, Medical Inspector of Iceland, told him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When, in 1000 <span class="fs70">A.D.</span>, Christianity was first introduced into Iceland,
the heathen party in the Althing credited the wrath of their gods
with a volcanic eruption which broke out on a neighbouring farm.
Snorri, the great Icelandic historian, being present, asked, “What
then was it that made the gods angry when the older lava was on
fire?” It clearly was not Christianity then. He carried the day
against the gods by this common-sense question, and Christianity
became the law of the land.</p>

<p>Somewhat parallel with this history is the claim made for the
extirpation of Smallpox by Vaccination in Iceland. It is a case of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante hoc</i> pricking the windbag of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc</i>, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter hoc</i>.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p></div>

<p>Whilst thus the Icelandic Vaccination Bubble is burst,
it remains to be observed that if vaccination had saved
the Icelanders from smallpox it could only have been
vicariously&mdash;as in so many instances of similar salvation;
for during the first half of the present century no more
than 17,072 vaccinations were effected in a population
of between fifty and sixty thousand in the flux of birth
and death. The vaccinations are thus recorded&mdash;</p>

<p>There is much of the like order of “facts in favour of
vaccination” current concerning other European populations,
which only pass muster because they are rarely
subjected to criticism; because vaccination is considered
such a benign invention that to question its credentials
is wicked; and because it is held that if even some of
the claims made for it are touched with fable, yet their
effect on the popular mind is so clearly for good in
inspiring confidence and overwhelming occasional mishaps,
that it is inexpedient to be over-scrupulous. But,
however instructive and wholesome may be the exposure
of such sophistications, it is necessary to restrain ourselves,
and for the remainder of my Story we shall keep
to English ground.</p>

<p>From the preceding details we see how far vaccination
in Sweden, Denmark and Iceland fell short of the claims
made for it by Jenner and his successors. Jenner, it is
true, died in 1823, before the more pronounced refutations
of his assertions had been evolved, but, as said, it is
questionable whether he ever realised that the names of
countries stood for millions of men, women and children
whose vaccination could only be overtaken by organised
exertion in the process of years. His various boasts,
therefore, of vaccinated nations and exterminated smallpox
are to be taken as proofs of defective arithmetical
capacity and of that scientific imagination which runs
with possibility and matter-of-fact.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">NEWCASTLE SMALLPOX: A COMMON STORY.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">To examine the statistics of the larger English towns in
order to determine whether vaccination has had any
influence on the abatement of smallpox, would involve
us in discussion interminable. For our immediate
purpose it may suffice to select three examples; 1st,
<span class="smcap">Newcastle-on-Tyne</span>, as an instance of a common story;
2nd, <span class="smcap">Norwich</span>, as an instance of a smallpox epidemic;
and 3rd, <span class="smcap">Glasgow,</span> as an instance of smallpox displaced
and replaced as a factor of mortality.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">THE NEWCASTLE DISPENSARY.</h4>

<p>We often hear of “the statistics of the Anti-Vaccinators;”
to which the summary answer is that Anti-Vaccinators
have no statistics. Their statistics are the
statistics of the Vaccinators, in which they provide the
material for their own condemnation; which is probably
the reason why the so-called statistics of the Anti-Vaccinators
are so intensely disliked, avoided, and
unanswered.</p>

<p>The Newcastle Dispensary in 1877 completed its
hundredth year, having been founded in 1777, and Dr.
Monteith prepared a concise history of the institution,
which was published in 1878 by order of the Committee.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
The report is especially valuable as a record of the comparative
incidence of disease in a large industrial population,
where, if anywhere, smallpox might be expected to
show itself in severe form. In 1781 the population of
Newcastle was estimated at 23,000; in 1821 it had risen
to 41,794; in 1851 to 87,784; and in 1871 to 128,443; and
through all these years and changes, the Dispensary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
continued in active operation, the percentage of the
patients to the population being maintained with remarkable
uniformity. It is needless to add that the majority
of the patients have been from the ranks of the poor,
among whom smallpox has always its chief seat. As
Dr. Monteith observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They are the class intermediate between the well-to-do working-man
and the pauper. The state of distress in which these people
continually live is known to few. The patient, when visited by
the doctor, is usually found lying in “poverty, hunger, and dirt,”
and the treatment of the cases is undertaken in circumstances very
unpropitious to success. Medical advice and medicine are not the
only things needed. Good food, warmth, and judicious nursing
are imperatively required, and are seldom if ever attainable.</p></div>

<p>Before turning to the Dispensary’s record of a century
of smallpox, it may be well to observe that Variolation
was practised in Newcastle with great assiduity, and
that the Dispensary took a lead in the business, the
surgeons inoculating any one who applied. Dr. Monteith
relates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the year 1777 the arguments in favour of Variolation had so
far triumphed over the habits and prejudices of the profession that
there is no instance mentioned in our reports of any medical man
in Newcastle opposing it. It is always spoken of as one of the best
established facts of medical science. With the general public the
case was different. Their prejudices were as strong as ever, and
they exhibited a horror of Variolation which would satisfy the most
ardent Anti-Vaccinator. To combat these prejudices various means
were tried&mdash;sermons from the pulpit, pathetic exhortations in the
newspapers, etc. The last and most convincing argument consisted
of a pecuniary reward to parents who should allow their children
to undergo the operation. The sum offered was 5s. for one child,
7s. for two, 9s. for three, and 10s. for four, and upwards. The success
of this expedient was remarkable. Parents came flocking in
with their children in great numbers. Tempted by the rewards,
they subjected their little ones to an operation which, unless their
sentiments had greatly altered, they believed to be barbarous and
hurtful in the extreme, and a clear temptation of Providence.
Variolation on these terms commenced in the spring of 1786; and
every year thereafter, until 1801, children were operated on at the
Dispensary at the rate of over 200 per annum. In 1801 there had
been in all 3,268 operated upon.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Vaccination came into vogue, Variolation
was denounced as the chief cause of the existence of
smallpox. It was said that what was done to avert the
disease from the individual diffused it among the multitude.
Vaccinators long maintained that they could
easily exterminate smallpox, if only Variolators would
refrain from keeping it alive. Variolation gradually
ceased, and was formally prohibited in 1840, and by and
by Vaccination was made compulsory. Nevertheless, the
confident prophecy of the Vaccinators remains unfulfilled,
for smallpox is not exterminated.</p>

<p>The change from Variolation to Vaccination at the
Newcastle Dispensary was immediate. Dr. Monteith
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is creditable to the good sense and enlightenment of the Dispensary
authorities that they <em>at once</em> abolished Inoculation of
Smallpox, and substituted Vaccination in its stead. In 1801, the
first year, 215 children were vaccinated. The annual number
rapidly rose until it reached its maximum in 1813, when 1,874
were vaccinated, after which the numbers as rapidly declined.</p></div>

<p>For this decline various reasons were assigned, such
as the increase of the private practice of vaccination, and
the disposition to undervalue every benefit, however
great, that is purely eleemosynary. It is forgotten that
Vaccination fell off as its illusory character became more
and more manifest, and as the promises made on its
behalf were, one and all, indisputably belied. When
Jenner died in 1823, he passed away amid indifference,
if not contempt. His bubble had burst. The furore for
vaccination witnessed in the present generation is by
no means a continuation of the original furore. That
passed away. Our furore is a revival, dating from the
popularity of sanitary reform, to the back of which a
new generation of medical men contrived to attach
vaccination!</p>

<p>In the hundred years, 1777 to 1877, the Dispensary
had to deal with 2,616 cases of smallpox, of which 428
terminated fatally, which as to years and mortality may
be thus classified&mdash;</p>

<p>The progressive reduction in mortality is, of course,
ascribed to vaccination having made the disease milder;
though the report informs us that “the mortality from
smallpox reached its highest point&mdash;33·3 per cent. in the
five years from 1802 to 1807,” the very time when
enthusiasm in favour of the Jennerian rite was at its
acme. We, on the other hand, would attribute the
lower mortality, as did Dr. Andrew Combe, to better
modes of treatment, even neglect being preferable to
much of the old-fashioned regimen for smallpox. Considering
the figures, Dr. Monteith observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of Smallpox I desire to speak with circumspection, for in Newcastle
Anti-Vaccinators are somewhat rampant. Figures, however,
are stubborn things, and their import is not easily explained away.
Like the vast majority of medical men, I have always firmly believed
in the good results of Vaccination. Without admitting that
my faith has been shaken by considering these statistics, I must
confess that I have been a good deal disappointed with them. I
had expected to find this terrible disease regularly decimating the
population every year until the epoch of Jenner’s discovery, and
afterwards diminishing, rapidly and steadily, almost to nothing.
These figures do not warrant us in taking so sanguine a view of
the matter.</p>

<p>Whilst, therefore, we observe considerable improvement in the
figures, I am of opinion that they leave us in this dilemma&mdash;either
that there now exists a grossly exaggerated impression of the prevalence
and fatality of Smallpox in former times, or else that they
had begun to decrease long before the discovery of Vaccination,
the beneficial effects of which must, therefore, have been at least
assisted by other causes.</p></div>

<p>Here we have an honourable confession from out the
bonds of professional prejudice, and a reluctant exposure
of the legend of a world decimated by smallpox, and
ceasing to be decimated after the advent of Jenner.
There is nothing singular in the Newcastle evidence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
has awakened distrust in the mind of Dr. Monteith. Similar
evidence is found wherever facts are available. The
legend to the contrary has become established, like many
other legends, by dint of repetition, until those who venture
to question it are regarded with suspicion and dislike.</p>

<p>The Report of the Newcastle Dispensary illustrates
another truth, namely, that the abatement or cessation
of smallpox is by no means equivalent to a reduction of
death; that evil conditions of life remaining unchanged, a
fall in smallpox is compensated for by a rise in some cognate
form of zymotic disease. Thus Dr. Monteith remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is generally said by the opponents of Vaccination that the
other exanthemata have increased since its introduction. It must
be allowed that our figures (probably unreliable as general data),
give some support to this supposition. The proportion of cases
of Scarlatina in the five years, 1827-32 was 4·3 per cent. It has
never reached that high limit since; but the percentage has never
fallen below 2 in the last thirty-five years. Mortality has also increased
to an alarming extent. At one time so low as 2·5 per cent.,
it has amounted to 17 per cent. in the last five years. Scarlatina
is now by far the most fatal disease on the list, with the exception
of Consumption.</p></div>

<p>Of Scarlatina, the Dispensary record stands thus&mdash;</p>

may be regarded as convertible forms of infantile zymotic
disease. Conditions of existence remaining equal, one
may be the substitute of the other, maintaining thereby
a common death-rate. Diarrhœa is sometimes placed in
the same category; and, like erysipelas, it is to a large
extent a consequence of vaccination. It should never be
forgotten that vaccination induces a constitutional disturbance
or fever, which illness is offered to Nature as a
propitiation for smallpox; with which propitiation, say
the vaccinators, Nature is satisfied, and withholds the
infliction of smallpox. Vaccination, as an illness, however,
is frequently attended with diarrhœa, and the
increase of that affection, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>, with the increase
of infant vaccination, is marked. Thus stands the record
of Diarrhœa&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Monteith observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mortality from Diarrhœa is unfortunately steadily increasing,
the percentage for the last five years, 1872-77, being the highest
on record&mdash;viz., 14·4. The majority of the deaths takes place
among infants; and the disease is produced in most cases by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
ignorance or carelessness of mothers in giving them food which is
not fit for them. But why this should be the case now any more
than it was twenty or fifty years ago, I cannot understand. An
increased consumption of alcoholic stimulants in later times has
been suggested to me as an explanation.</p></div>

<p>Any explanation is welcome that will preserve vaccination
from reproach, yet what medical man is ignorant
of the fact that diarrhœa is one of the commonest
sequences of vaccination? Nature thus endeavouring to
throw off the effects of the virus infused into the blood.</p>

<p>Taking, then, these five diseases in the order of their
mortality, they range thus&mdash;</p>

<p>In the course of a century the Newcastle Dispensary
had dealt with a total of 250,637 cases, of which no more
than 2,616 were of smallpox, or about 1 in 96. The
total deaths during the century were 14,088, of which no
more than 428 were due to smallpox, or about 1 in 33;
whilst from scarlatina they were 1 in 18, from diarrhœa
1 in 30, and from whooping-cough 1 in 35. It may be
said, the record of the Dispensary does not account for
the population of Newcastle. True; but it accounts for
the lower strata of the population, and, therefore, for an
excessive proportion of smallpox. The complete statistics
of the city would exhibit smallpox as a still lighter
affliction. And, we repeat, there is nothing singular
about the record of the Newcastle Dispensary. It is a
common story. Whenever we get out of the region of
romance, and tread the ground of matter-of-fact, it is to
discover that the wilder horrors and ravages of smallpox
have been originally evolved from imagination, and are
perpetuated in ignorance from hearsay.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE NORWICH EPIDEMIC&mdash;1819.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">I have repeatedly cautioned my readers against the
common assumption that the London smallpox of last
century was the measure of English smallpox. It was
not so. Smallpox was endemic in London, whereas it
occurred as an occasional epidemic in other English
towns, and was almost unknown in many rural districts.
Moreover, the disease was not allowed to die out, but
was diligently cultivated and diffused by variolation.
As vaccination was introduced, the practice of variolation
correspondently ceased, and with its cessation there was
an abatement of smallpox, which abatement was unwarrantably
ascribed to vaccination. How much of the smallpox
of last century was due to variolation it is impossible
to determine; nor would it be safe to accept the assertions
of the early advocates of vaccination on the point. I
apprehend that if smallpox were something desirable
which everyone was intent on catching, it would be discovered
that it could not be universally caught, and that
its propagation had definite limits; and it is not improbable
that among Londoners the limit of propagation
was closely approached, so that nearly all who were susceptible
contracted the disease. What, however, I wish
to enforce is, that the decline in the prevalence of smallpox
in some places coincidently with the introduction of
vaccination was largely due to the discontinuance of
smallpox culture, and that the suppression of that culture
would have given the same result. Nor let it be forgotten
that an almost world-wide fall in smallpox had
set in toward the close of last century, which the vaccinators
attributed to their prophylaxy in the nineteenth.
Miraculous effects are frequently asserted where miraculous
causes would be disowned.</p>

<p>The vital statistics of last century are, to a great extent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the products of inference and conjecture, and more
or less affected by the purpose and bias of their collectors;
but if even we had the correct mortalities of smallpox in
the chief centres of population,&mdash;such as York, Hull,
Norwich, Chester, Coventry, Bath, Bristol, Exeter, and
Plymouth&mdash;we should still be puzzled to separate what
was due to insanitary conditions of life from what
was due to the artificial induction of the disease by
variolation. It has been said that the 18th Century did
not terminate in England until 1830; and accepting that
liberal allowance, we may resort to an interesting record
of a virulent epidemic in Norwich in 1819 for some light
on the character and incidence of urban smallpox prior
to the rise of such great communities as Liverpool, Manchester,
Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham. The account
of the epidemic was written by John Cross, a surgeon
practising in Norwich.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>In those days Norwich contained a population of about
40,000. The city was accounted salubrious, and smallpox
was little known. Cross writes that “in 1805, <em>after
being for a time almost extinct</em>, smallpox prevailed so
much in Norwich as to excite some attention.” The
attention excited led to an attempt to introduce vaccination.
A meeting was held in the Guildhall, 16th July,
1805, “to concert measures for the extermination of the
disease,” and resolutions were passed to discourage inoculation
with smallpox, and “to substitute immediate
and universal vaccination of the inhabitants of the city
and its hamlets.” This outbreak of smallpox and vaccination
appears to have subsided together, for Cross
continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After being absent for a year or two, Smallpox was again introduced
to Norwich by an individual from London, and spread so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
extensively among those whose obstinacy or whose prejudices made
them resist Vaccination, that 203 deaths from Smallpox were recorded
in the Bills of Mortality between 1807 and the end of 1809.
Smallpox again appeared in 1813, in which year 65 deaths took
place; the mortality being confined to so small a number by the
early and extensive adoption of Vaccination before the danger was
actually at hand. From the year of 1813, it may be said, there
was no Smallpox in Norwich until the rise of the epidemic which
I propose to describe. Not a death from the disease was noticed
for four years. Indeed, the only case that came to my knowledge,
during the time specified, was the servant of a celebrated public
character, who, being seized with Smallpox, was detained in Norwich,
but from whom, so far as I could learn, the contagion did
not extend.</p></div>

<p>I shall presently refer to the number of vaccinations
effected in Norwich, and to their influence in arresting
smallpox. What I would now draw attention to is, the
comparative rarity of smallpox in Norwich in those
times. Years two, three, and four elapsed without a
single death from the disease! How does such a fact
accord with the common-place of vaccinators, that before
the advent of Jenner the people of England were decimated
with smallpox, and that 40,000 perished annually?
When we press for evidence for these extraordinary statements,
we either get no answer, or we discover that the
mortality of a bad year of London smallpox has been
multiplied by the population of the United Kingdom, thus
yielding the astounding total of 40,000 victims. Our
reply is, that there is no warrant whatever for this conversion
of London mortality into national mortality;
that London was unique in its circumstances; and that,
setting the immense rural majority aside, even in the
largest cities, such as Norwich, years passed without any
deaths from smallpox.</p>

<p>Vaccination had the prestige of fashion, and the leading
citizens of Norwich were philanthropic and scientific
after the newest lights, and whatever was accounted
“proper,” they were intent to effect. To have the vulgar
vaccinated was, however, no easy matter. Many declined
because they had no fear of smallpox. What, indeed,
had they to be alarmed about? Moreover, as experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
advanced, the futility and danger of the new inoculation
became more and more apparent. It began to be known
that it not only failed to avert smallpox, but it frequently
induced serious illness, permanent injury, and sometimes
death. It is to be remembered that the symptoms of
vaccination were watched at the outset of the practice
with keen attention, and that the general verdict,
especially of mothers, was distinctly adverse to its harmlessness.
That such was the common judgment was
manifest from the rapid decline of the early furore in its
favour, and its contemptuous neglect by the mass of the
people until revived and enforced by legislation. As
the citizens of Norwich would not be vaccinated, it was
determined to try the effect of bribery, and surgeon
Rigby in 1812 induced the court of guardians to offer a
reward of 2s. 6d. to every person “who should bring a
certificate from a surgeon of having gone satisfactorily
through the cowpox.” The results of this bribery are
set forth as follows by Cross&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The larger numbers in 1813, ’16, and ’19 were due to
panic and pressure; but the figures maybe taken for a
graphic representation of the distrust with which vaccination
was regarded after ample experience. Of course
many were vaccinated who did not claim the parish
half-crown; and at the end of 1819 it was calculated that
10,000 in Norwich had submitted to the Jennerian rite
from the date of its introduction at the beginning of the
century. Thus considerably less than a fourth of the
inhabitants were what is called “protected.”</p>

<p>We now come to the narrative of that great outbreak
of smallpox, which, says Cross, destroyed more lives in
less time in Norwich than any epidemic since the Plague.
It is almost superfluous to state that the disease did not
originate in Norwich: it never appears to originate anywhere:
it was imported. A girl travelling with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
parents from York caught the infection in transit at a
market-town, and as soon as she arrived in Norwich was
laid up with the disease.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This happened [says Cross] in the latter end of June, 1818; and
the earliest cases of Smallpox that were seen by any medical man
were traced to this origin. I have been able to ascertain the
different families by which the disease was kept up during the
remainder of that year, but it extended to very few, and proved
fatal in only two instances. A druggist inoculated three children
in January, 1819, thus helping in a small degree to spread the
contagion, which the season of the year was calculated to keep
within narrow bounds. Still no alarm was excited; a single medical
man only was acquainted with the disease; and the cases of
Smallpox were so few until the latter end of February as to be
scarcely noticed. At this time, however, the disease extended
from one of our greatest charity schools to all quarters of the city....
Comparatively dormant during the winter, as the season
became milder it burst upon us suddenly and unexpectedly, continuing
its work of devastation for three or four months with undiminishing
fury. The following list of burials taken from the
Bills of Mortality will give a sufficiently accurate idea of the
advance and decline of the disease&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The greatest mortality occurred in June when 43 were buried from
Smallpox in one week. The rapid declension of the disease from
that period is obvious from the above table; and it was so nearly
extinct at the end of the year, that I could not find a variolous
patient from whom ichor could be procured for an important experiment.
As probably one in six of all who were affected by the
epidemic died of it, I am convinced it is not far from the truth to
assert that considerably over 3000 individuals, or a thirteenth part
of the whole population of Norwich, had Smallpox in the year 1819.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>It is always sound policy to take what is considered
the case against us at its worst; and as this dreadful
Norwich epidemic is cited as evidence of what is possible
in the absence of vaccination, and as something that
opponents of vaccination should regard as conclusive
against them, there is cause to give it special attention;
and the more so as the leading facts are well
ascertained. First, however, I would remark that I have
no desire to minimise the horrors of smallpox: it is a
loathsome, and, because preventible, a discreditable disease:
but neither let us maximise its horrors, but try, at
least, to recognise facts in their true dimensions.</p>

<p>Five hundred and thirty died in Norwich of smallpox
in 1819 of 3000 supposed to have had the disease, the
deaths being, as commonly estimated, one in five or one
in six of those affected. The deaths from all diseases in
Norwich in 1819 were 1352&mdash;a mortality of 30 per 1000;
a high rate, but by no means uncommon in urban populations
free from smallpox. I have next to observe that if
3000 had smallpox, there were 37,000 who escaped, and to
ask, How did they escape? By what means were they
protected? It may be replied that a fourth of them were
vaccinated; but how does that account for the immunity
of 30,000 unvaccinated? The 10,000 vaccinations reputed
to have been effected in Norwich from the beginning
of the century were the work of nearly twenty
years, and the major part of them in 1819 must have
been represented by adults practically out of the range
of infection, protected not by vaccination, but by their
years.</p>

<p>“Protected by their years! What do you mean?” exclaims
a reader.</p>

<p>Precisely what I say&mdash;that in the Norwich epidemic,
as in variolous epidemics generally, adults are comparatively
secure, and the young, and especially infants, are
the victims. In Norwich, in 1819, scarcely a bread-winner,
or a father or mother was laid in the grave slain
by smallpox.</p>

<p>“It is incredible!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>It is incredible simply because the facts of smallpox
are persistently overlooked. Here is proof of the incredible
in a statement carefully prepared by Cross of
the ages of the 530 who died in the Norwich epidemic&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be said, as a matter of course, that if these
children had been vaccinated they would not have
perished; but the answer is that at this day the chief
mortality of smallpox is among the vaccinated young, in
whom the whole virtue of the rite may be supposed to
abide fresh and efficient. Cross was an enthusiastic vaccinator,
but he allows, with due excuses, that the vaccinated
minority contributed a certain quota to the sick and
the dead, and that the ill repute of vaccination caused
many in their terror to resort to variolation, and thus to
incur and diffuse the mischief of which they stood in
dread. Some old women and a druggist were, he says,
responsible for four or five hundred of these creations of
smallpox during the epidemic, “each of which became a
centre of contagion.”</p>

<p>Age, I said, constituted the chief protection from
smallpox, but good houses and good fare formed another
line of defence. “The effects of the Norwich epidemic
were confined <em>almost exclusively</em>,” says Cross, “<em>to the very
lowest orders of the people</em>.” Moreover, he observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The disease was often aggravated, and made to assume its worst
characters, by the most injudicious treatment. The prejudiced
and most ignorant being the principal sufferers, the prescriptions
of old women were more listened to than the advice of medical
men. A practice kept up by tradition among the poor of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
for above a century was revived, in spite of all remonstrance, as
follows&mdash;</p>

<p>“At the commencement, to set the object before a large fire and
supply it plentifully with saffron and brandy to bring out the eruption;
during the whole of the next stage to keep it in bed covered
with flannel, and even the bed-curtains pinned together to prevent
a breath of air. To allow no change of linen for ten or more days,
until the eruption had turned; and to regard the best symptom to
be a costive state of the bowels during the whole course of the
disease.”</p>

<p>Such were the means by which the horrors of the epidemic were
aggravated. The old nurses triumphed not a little in having an
opportunity of showing their skill after it had been so long unexercised;
nor was it often easy, among the deluded persons in whose
families this affliction occurred, to persuade or compel them to
adopt a different plan of treatment.</p></div>

<p>Cross described several cases in which unquestionable
vaccination had been followed by unquestionable smallpox.
In one instance, a girl of eleven years of age,
correctly vaccinated in both arms, perished of malignant
smallpox, whilst her unvaccinated brother, six years of
age, recovered from a severe attack. Such cases in 1819
were treated as exceptional, but they have long passed
into the category of matter-of-course, and ceased to excite
observation or surprise.</p>

<p>Such was the memorable Norwich epidemic. However
dreadful, it was in no wise extraordinarily dreadful.
If the death-rate was raised for a single year, it would
be reduced in subsequent years, and the average rate recovered
that accorded with the common obedience of the
community to the laws of health. In Nature consequences
are equal, and any temporary aberration is in
the long run compensated for. If vaccination could have
kept smallpox from Norwich, the citizens would have
had in some other form the measure of disease that pertained
to their way of life.</p>

<p>We might, moreover, inquire, whether to escape an
epidemic, severe as that of 1819, it would have been
economical to put 40,000 people through the pains and
perils of vaccine fever. Why should a universal affliction
be incurred to avert a partial one?&mdash;an affliction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
confined to the young of the lower orders. The vaccination
of Norwich from 1801 to 1819 would have cost far
more sickness and death than did the smallpox of the
same years. In short, if vaccination had conferred the
immunity claimed for it, the price of the salvation would
have been in prodigious excess of its value.</p>

<p class="pfs60">DR. WATT’S DISCOVERY&mdash;GLASGOW, 1813.</p>


<p class="noindent">Addressing the House of Commons in 1878, Sir Thomas
Chambers said, “You cannot show that Vaccination has
reduced deaths, or saved a single life. There may be no
Smallpox, but the disappearance of Smallpox is by no
means equivalent to a reduction of mortality.” M.P.’s
were astonished and incredulous; but ignorantly. The
fact is incontestable; and Dr. Robert Watt of Glasgow
had the signal distinction of detecting and setting it
forth in the year 1813.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Watt was writing a treatise on Chincough, otherwise
Whooping Cough, and in the course of his work made a
careful examination of the registers of death in Glasgow
to ascertain how far it was true “that the disease was
more fatal some years than others; that it was more
dangerous at a particular age; and that the female sex
suffered more from it than the male;” and, from the outset
of his investigation, “was struck with the immense
numbers carried off yearly by the Smallpox.” He might
well be struck; for Glasgow was a rare place for Smallpox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>

<p>Considering these figures said Watt&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I remarked that the deaths by Smallpox were chiefly in infancy;
hence the deaths under two or three years of age bore a very great
proportion to the whole deaths in the city. Taking an average of
several years, I found that more than half the human species died
before they were ten years of age, and that of this half more than a
third died of the Smallpox; so that nearly a fifth part of all that
were born alive perished by this dreadful malady.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>Watt meant of course the human species as exhibited
in Glasgow, of whom more than half died before the age
of ten, and a fifth of smallpox. What was true for a
time of Glasgow smallpox was not even true of Edinburgh,
much less of the whole earth.</p>

<p>Variolation was practised in Glasgow, but to what
extent appears to be unknown. Certain, however, it is
that smallpox was as little dreaded as are other calamities
accounted common and unavoidable. Indeed many were
not unwilling to subject their offspring to the disease at
seasons supposed to be favourable on the principle of
“getting a bad job over.” Then, too, the mass of the
population was disposed as if by design for the generation
of febrile ailments. Tall buildings forming narrow
lanes, wynds, or closes issued like so many rents or
fissures from the leading thoroughfares. These buildings
were divided into flats packed with humanity from
basement to attic. Air and light were treated as superfluities.
Water there was none, save what was brought
from wells; and middens received the slops and refuse
often shot from the windows. Life in a Glasgow wynd
in former days is indescribable, yea almost inconceivable;
yet in such wynds multitudes passed their existence,
conscious of no hardship, recognising nothing better, and
withal characterised by many virtues. Bearing such
conditions in mind, the vital statistics of Glasgow excite
no surprise: the wonder is that the death-rate did not
draw nearer to extermination. As for smallpox, how
could a family resident in a flat in a noisome Glasgow
close at the end of last century escape smallpox, if smallpox
were prevalent? To them smallpox lay in fate, and
was accepted on the same terms as wind and weather,
summer and winter.</p>

<p>Novelties have always had a ready welcome in Glasgow,
and when cheap and easy salvation from smallpox was
proclaimed, there was a rush for it. Smallpox abated:
vaccination had the credit: and faith was justified. Considering
the devastation smallpox had wrought among
the young, Watt says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I began to reflect how different the case must be now; and to
calculate the great saving of human life that must have arisen from
the Vaccine Inoculation. At this time [1813] above 15,000 had
been inoculated publicly at the Faculty Hall, and perhaps twice or
thrice that number in private practice. In eight years [1805-12]
little more than 600 had died in Glasgow of Smallpox; whereas in
1784 the deaths by that disease alone amounted to 425, and in 1791
to 607; which, on both occasions, exceeded the fourth of the whole
deaths in the city for the year.</p></div>

<p>It seemed reasonable to infer that since the mortality
from smallpox had so largely declined, fewer children
must have died; but to Watt’s astonishment the facts
did not answer to the logic. He writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To ascertain the real amount of this saving of infantile life, I
turned up one of the later years, and by accident that of 1808, when
to my utter astonishment, I found that still a half, or more than a
half, perished before the tenth year of their age! I could hardly
believe the testimony of my senses, and therefore began to turn
up other years, when I found that in all of them the proportion
was less than in 1808; but still on taking an average of several
years, it amounted to nearly the same thing as at any former
period during the last thirty years. This was a discovery I by no
means expected, and how it could have come to pass appeared to
me inexplicable.</p></div>

<p>We shall better understand Watt’s perplexity over
smallpox reduced and death unaffected, if we set before
us the table of mortality for the decade during which
vaccination was brought into practice in Glasgow.</p>

<p>Before making any commentary on these remarkable
figures, it may be well to attend to what Watt had to
say concerning them. He was satisfied that vaccination
arrested smallpox, but it was plain that it did not arrest
death, and he felt bound to find some explanation&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From every circumstance that has come under my observation,
the efficacy of Vaccine Inoculation appeared certain. The experience
of pretty extensive practice had confirmed me fully in this
opinion. But still the question recurred, how are we to account
for the same, or nearly the same, number of deaths under ten
years of age? As no new disease has appeared, the deficiency
occasioned by the want of Smallpox must have been made up by
a greater mortality among the other diseases of children. Has it
been equally divided among them, or has a greater share fallen to
some than to others? To solve this question is the chief object of
my inquiry.</p></div>

<p>To ascertain the fact, he divided the thirty years,
1783-1812, into five periods of six years each, and thus
set forth the average proportionate mortalities&mdash;</p>

<p>The first three of these periods, 1783-1800, had passed before
the Vaccine Inoculation could have had any influence [observes
Watt]; in the fourth, 1801-1806, it had nearly reached its maximum;

established, perhaps as much so as in any other city in the empire.</p></div>

off, but if its victims were merely assigned to other modes
of death, where was the advantage? Watt continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first thing which strikes the mind on surveying the preceding
Table, is the vast diminution in the proportion of deaths by the
Smallpox&mdash;a reduction from 19·55 to 3·90 per cent.; but the increase
in the Measles column is still more remarkable&mdash;an increase from
·93 to 10·76 per cent. In Smallpox we have the deaths reduced to
nearly a fifth of what they were twenty-five years ago, whilst in
the same period, the deaths by Measles have increased more than
eleven times. This is a fact so striking, that I am astonished it
has not attracted the notice of older practitioners.</p>

<p>The greatest number of deaths from Smallpox in any one month
during the last thirty years was 114 in October, 1791. In the
following December they were 113. These are the only two
instances in thirty years when the deaths by Smallpox amounted
to 100 in a month. But these were slight visitations when compared
with the ravages which have been committed in an equally
short time by Measles. In May, 1803, the deaths by Measles
alone amounted to 259, in June to 260, and in July to 118. In
December, 1811, they amounted to 161, and in the January following
to 130. What an amazing difference when we compare these
numbers with 433, the sum of all the deaths by Measles in eighteen
years preceding 1801! In the last five years 1430 have died of
Measles in Glasgow.</p></div>

<p>This prodigious increase in the mortality from Measles
was naturally referred by some observers to the practice
of Vaccination, and Watt held there was ground for the
assumption inasmuch as when Smallpox preceded Measles
it made Measles milder&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Measles was so prevalent and fatal in 1808, I was often
told that it was owing to the Vaccine Inoculation; but this I
considered an idle tale, the invention of those who were hostile to
Cowpox. I could readily admit that more must die of Measles
than formerly; for some of the weak and unhealthy, who would
have died of Smallpox (saved from Smallpox) would fall a sacrifice
to Measles; but I could not then go farther.</p>

<p>But however novel and strange the opinion may appear, it must
be admitted that while Smallpox was in full force, it had the power
of modifying and rendering Measles mild; and now that Smallpox
is in great measure expelled, Measles is gradually coming to occupy
the same ground. I am sorry to make this statement, but the
facts, at least with regard to Glasgow, are too strong to admit of
doubt....</p>

<p>That Measles should have been modified by Smallpox is rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
highly probable by the manner in which the Vaccine Disease prevents
Smallpox or renders it so mild as to be without the smallest
danger. May not Smallpox have a similar effect in relation to
Measles?</p>

<p>When Smallpox was in full force, few children escaped, and
most of those who had Smallpox and Measles had Smallpox first.
This, I believe, will have been the case with more than nine-tenths
of the community. Still, however, as Measles came round, it
occasionally had precedence of Smallpox, and it was perhaps
chiefly among such patients that it proved fatal. In looking over
the registers of former years, I find the deaths by Measles were
generally among very young children.</p></div>

<p>He was even disposed to believe that Smallpox, on the
whole, exercised a beneficial influence in the eradication
of latent disease&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An opinion has prevailed with some, that Vaccination does
positive harm by infusing peccant or vicious humour into the
constitution. I do not see the smallest ground for this hypothesis;
but that Smallpox does good to those who survive the disease by
rendering the system insusceptible of other infections, or by rendering
them milder when incurred, must, I think, be admitted....
I do not presume that the constitution is improved by
Smallpox, but perhaps by eradicating certain unobserved deviations
from health, which, if not early removed by the accession of some
acute disease, would have proved the seeds of early mortality by
gaining a deeper hold of the constitution before Measles and other
epidemics of later appearance came round.</p>

<p>In this point of view, we are not to consider Smallpox as
peculiarly fatal, but fatal merely as having the start of some other
diseases. Measles, Chincough, Croup, and Scarlet Fever would
have proved equally fatal had any of them occurred first....
It is only on this principle that we can explain how it happened
that thirty years ago not one in a hundred died of Measles,
whereas now one in ten dies. Thirty years ago as few escaped
Measles as now, but before they were affected they had generally
passed through Smallpox, by which the secondary disease was so
modified as to be almost completely divested of danger.</p></div>

<p>Watt, it will be observed, treats smallpox throughout
as a malady of childhood; thus confirming Monro’s
observation in 1765, that “the inhabitants of Scotland
generally have smallpox in their infancy or childhood,
very few adults being seen in the disease.”</p>

<p>From the preceding excerpts, it is not difficult to comprehend
Watt’s position. He was persuaded of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
prophylaxy of vaccination; he was satisfied that it had
reduced smallpox in Glasgow; but, to his astonishment,
he discovered that it had not reduced the general death-rate;
and that in so far as smallpox had been displaced,
other ailments, and specially measles, had maintained the
tale of fatality.</p>

<p>The discovery that the fall in smallpox was compensated
for by a rise in deaths from other diseases was
a remarkable discovery, the importance of which is as
yet far from appreciated. Watt was however at fault in
attributing the decline of smallpox in Glasgow to vaccination;
and in failing to inquire whether the phenomenon
had any relation to vaccination whatever. He is the
best scientific demonstrater who most completely exhausts
the possibilities to the contrary of what he seeks to
establish. Supposing vaccination to be as powerful
against smallpox as its promoters averred, the causes in
Glasgow was not commensurate with the effect. Nowhere
was vaccination more practised. 15,000 were vaccinated
at the Faculty Hall, says Watt, “<em>and perhaps twice or
thrice that number in private practice</em>”&mdash;a loose and
questionable statement. The 15,000 operated on at the
Faculty Hall in the course of ten years were the poor,
the vast majority in Glasgow and elsewhere, and the
chief sufferers from smallpox. The assumed “twice or
thrice that number” were those who employed their own
medical men&mdash;a luxury less common then than now.
The population of Glasgow approached 100,000, and it is
obvious that the larger part must have lived outside the
fortification of the Jennerian rite.</p>

<p>But admitting that all, or nearly all, in Glasgow were
vaccinated who had not had smallpox, still that would
afford no proof for what was claimed. Watt was
cautious, and held closely by his Glasgow evidence,
content to have it taken for what it was worth; but had
he ranged wider, he would have discovered that the fall
in smallpox extended over Europe, and was as well
marked in Vienna as in Glasgow, in Stockholm as in
London, in Italy as in Denmark. As in Glasgow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
credit for the fall was claimed for vaccination, but the
fall had set in before vaccination was heard of, and
extended over populations to which vaccination had no
application. Indeed Watt allows that the fatality of
smallpox had begun to decline and that of measles to
increase prior to the conveyance of the Jennerian salvation
to Glasgow; but he failed to discern the significance
of the fact. So too in other cities where smallpox fell
off: the death-rate did not fall off; but, as in Glasgow,
was kept up by cognate varieties of fever.</p>

<p>As concerns Watt, we have the advantage of some
notes upon his “remarkable treatise” by Dr. William
Farr in the <cite>Thirtieth Annual Report of the Registrar-General</cite>,
1869. Having given an abstract of Watt’s
results, Dr. Farr observes of his discovery of displaced
and replaced mortality&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is an important point in pathology; and it must be admitted
that although there were defects in his data, Dr. Watt succeeds in
showing (1) that Smallpox was one of the greatest causes of death
in Glasgow down to the year 1800, (2) that the deaths by Smallpox
were reduced to a fifth of their original number by Vaccination,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
and (3) that the children died in nearly the same numbers as
before, but of other forms of disease.</p>

<p>Glasgow has always been famous for statistics, and these unfortunately
show an increase of the mortality of children. Thus in
the five years 1821-25 the mortality of boys under five years of age
was 8·08; in 1831-35 it was 9·78. In the year 1865 the mortality
of boys in Glasgow was 11·48, of girls, 10·36. These recent returns
confirm the principle. Smallpox is no longer so fatal as it was
before Vaccination was introduced; in Glasgow it caused in the
year 1864 no longer 20 but 2 in 100 deaths&mdash;only 180 in 6054
deaths, that is 3 per cent. of the deaths under five years of age;
yet the mortality of children is certainly as high, probably higher,
than it was in the last 10 years of the last century.</p>

<p>Compulsory Vaccination in England has reduced further the
fatality of Smallpox, but since 1853 other diseases have so prevailed
as to counter-balance the gain under this head. The mortality
of children has not declined in a corresponding degree.</p></div>

<p>With confirmation under such authority, it is needless
to enforce the validity and importance of Watt’s discovery.
Dr. Farr is pleased to ascribe the subsidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
smallpox alike in England and Glasgow to vaccination,
but he makes no effort to prove his case: indeed the
effort might have led him to recognise his mistake.
Referring to scarlet-fever, he shows how from a mild it
has become a severe affliction&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sydenham (d. 1689) describes simple Scarlatina distinctly: he
does not refer to the throat affections, and says the patient can
only die by the doctor’s default. Joseph Frank describes the
disease as <em>now</em> the most dreadful scourge in Europe.</p></div>

<p>If then scarlet fever has of itself acquired this terrible
intensity and predominance, why should it be thought
incredible that smallpox of itself should undergo correspondent
mitigation and diminution? Or, is it to be
argued that vaccination has extinguished smallpox to
revive as scarlet fever?</p>

<p>Dr. Farr proceeds to observe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is singular that Dr. Watt, evidently a practitioner of great
sagacity, does not at all advert to the wretched sanitary condition
in which the increasing population of Glasgow lived at the time he
was writing.</p></div>

<p>It is the observation of Dr. Farr that is singular. At
the time when Watt wrote there was no clear conception
of the relation of condition to disease. Jenner was
always writing about smallpox, yet there is not a hint
in any of his papers as to its development in filth and
stench. His own residence was a pesthouse, but it never
entered into his head to ask, Why? Let us avoid
anachronism. Those whose memory or reading extends
to the cholera epidemic of 1831-32 will know, that it
was regarded as an inscrutable visitation toward which
humble submission was the proper attitude. A letter of
Collins, the artist, to the Rev. R. A. Thorpe, 26th
November, 1831, correctly expresses the common feeling.
Referring to the Cholera and the Reform Bill, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the two scourges now afflicting us, I know not which is the
worse, but I <em>do</em> know that we have fallen into the hands of God in
both cases, and not before we deserved it.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>I myself recollect the dismay the Combes excited in
Scotland when they began to teach that we were largely
responsible for our ailments, and that sickness and
sanctity were an unwholesome alliance; and how a pious
physician remarked, when the prevalence of typhus in
Glasgow had been denounced as disgraceful to the
authorities, “We have learnt the truth in another school,
and would shudder to impeach the Divine prerogative in
life or in death.” What Watt really thought of smallpox
is to be found in a passage of his treatise which Dr. Farr
must have overlooked. He says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We may it seems, by the permission of Divine Providence,
deprive death of some of its apparently most efficient means, but
deprived of these, new means are discovered, or the old improved.</p>

<p>I cannot help quoting the following passage from Dr. Woolcombe
as somewhat prophetic of this general result. Says he&mdash;</p>

<p>“May not the discovery of the Cowpox, if it should ultimately
effect the extermination of the Smallpox, which it may do when
the prejudices of mankind shall permit, be welcomed rather on
account of its influence in diminishing human suffering, than on
account of its effect in diminishing human mortality? Since
disease is one of the appointed checks to excessive population, and
the plan of Providence in the creation of human life requires the
termination of the existence of one-third of its creatures before
they have attained the age of two years, it may be doubted whether
the annihilation of so efficient an instrument as Smallpox can be
admitted without the substitution of some other equally destructive
malady. The substituted malady may indeed be productive of less
collateral affliction than the loathsome distemper whose place it
supplies. But granting that no direct substitute should arise, it
will not follow that disease in general will be deprived of its accustomed
share in checking population; and if it be not, the only
difference will be in the proportion of victims submitted to other
disorders. The infant rescued from Smallpox, may be rescued
only to perish in childhood by Measles or Scarlatina, or be preserved
to swell the list of youthful victims to the insatiate maw of
Consumption.”<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p></div>

<p>Such was the manner in which Watt dealt with the
problem of mortality. Sanitation had no place in his
consideration. It was, he thought, the design of Providence
to limit population, and if children were saved
from smallpox, they would be cut off otherwise; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
statistics of Glasgow confirmed the opinion. Smallpox
had abated, but funerals were numerous as ever. The
uniformity of the mortality we admit, but no longer
ascribe it to Providence intent on the limitation of population.
If children die, it is not of fate, but from the
ignorance, or indifference, or wickedness of those who are
responsible for them.</p>

<p>Still some may object, “If by vaccination or any other
means smallpox is got rid of, Should we not to that
extent save life?” The answer is, No. Life is only
extensible in so far as improvement is effected in the
conditions of life. Forms of disease are subject to modification;
they are probably convertible and interchangeable;
one form comes as another goes; but conditions
remaining the same, the crop of death is equal. Hence
Mr. Edwin Chadwick’s advice&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Keep your eye on the death-rate. Let nothing short of its
reduction satisfy you. There may be no startling outbreak of this
fever or of that fever; but if the death-rate is unabated, there can
be no improvement that ought to satisfy you. The death-rate is
the test of sanitary progress. Keep therefore your eye on the
death-rate.</p></div>

<p>Thus it was that though smallpox subsided in Glasgow
no lives were saved; for no change for the better having
taken place in the condition of the inhabitants, the means
of death were merely transferred to other agencies. As
Dr. Farr observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Glasgow victims were gathered together from all quarters,
from the Highlands, from Ireland, and from elsewhere; they were
lodged in conditions unsuitable to human life.... To render them
unassailable by the matter of Smallpox was not enough, for it left
them exposed to the other forms of disease. Thus in a garden
where the flowers are neglected, to keep off thistle-down merely
leaves the ground open to the world of surrounding weeds.</p>

<p>To operate on mortality, protection against every one of the fatal
zymotic diseases is required; otherwise the suppression of one
disease-element opens the way to another.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Farr thus exactly expresses what I wish to enforce.
Whether smallpox prevail or disappear is of little importance.
What is of importance is the prevalence of disease
and death, and not the presence or absence of any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
their special factors when the total result is constant
and the measure of violated physiological laws. It is
true that Dr. Farr recognises a virtue in vaccination, but
on much the same terms that obeisance is rendered to a
fetish. Vaccination might be struck out of his arguments
without affecting his conclusions. How, for example,
could the facts with their rationale be better stated than
in these his words?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Out of 1000 born in Liverpool, 518 children were destroyed in
the first ten years of their life; some by Smallpox, many by
Measles, Scarlatina, Whooping Cough, many by Typhus and
Enteric Fever; one disease prevailing in one year, another disease
prevailing in another; <em>but still yielding the like fatal results</em>.
This represents what Dr. Watt found in Glasgow long ago. Out
of 1000 children born in London, 351 died under ten years of age
by zymotic diseases and other causes; the deaths are less by 167
than the deaths in Liverpool. How much less is the loss of life
by these diseases in the healthy districts of England! There, out
of 1000, only 205 children die in the first ten years of life. The
enormous difference cannot be ascribed to Vaccination, as common
in town as in country; the protection of life against Smallpox
alone leaves it still at the mercy of the dangerous diseases of the
insalubrious city.</p></div>

<p>Death from disease in insalubrious circumstances is
but part of the mischief. Those who survive find their
energies enfeebled and depressed in the struggle for
survival. The time must surely come when smallpox
and all allied forms of disease will be accounted discreditable
and intolerable, and when their occurrence will be
taken for notes of warning and command to search for
and root out their causes. Then, too, magical preventives
and palliatives and medical cures will have a very
different place in the popular imagination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jenner read Watt’s pamphlet, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more suo</i>, the
wretched creature failed to discern its scope and significance,
seeing in it a malevolent aggression upon his
interest in vaccination. He wrote to Moore from
Cheltenham, 6th December, 1813&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You probably may not have seen a pamphlet lately published
by Dr. Watt, as there is nothing in its title that develops its purport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
or <em>evil tendency</em>. Measles, it seems, has been extremely fatal
in Glasgow for the last four or five years among children, and
during this period Vaccination has been practised almost universally.
Previously to this, Measles was considered a mild disease.
Hence Dr. Watt infers that Smallpox is a kind of <em>preparative</em> for
Measles, rendering the disease more mild. In short, he says, or
seems to say, that we have gained nothing by the introduction of
Cowpox; for that Measles and Smallpox have now changed places
with regard to their fatal tendency. Is not this very shocking?
Here is a new and unexpected twig shot forth for the sinking
Anti-Vaccinist to cling to.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p></div>

<p>Observe, the truth of Dr. Watt’s evidence was passed
over! Inasmuch as it did not tend to the glory of vaccination,
it was “evil,” and it was “shocking.” At a
later date Baron assumed the same line, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding the proofs of the power of Vaccination in diminishing
the mortality from Smallpox, it has been a question
whether <em>infantile</em> mortality has been diminished; it having been
supposed that the beneficial effects of Vaccination were countervailed
by a greater mortality in the other diseases of children.
This very discouraging statement was published by Dr. Watt, of
Glasgow; and the opinion, which was hastily adopted and unwisely
promulgated, has unquestionably had a great effect in retarding
the progress of Vaccination. It, unfortunately, gave countenance
to some of the worst prejudices of those who were opposed to the
practice.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p></div>

<p>Here again we see no attempt made to disprove Watt’s
statement, whilst its mischievousness was assumed because
it was “discouraging,” and lent “countenance to
some of the worst prejudices of those who were opposed
to vaccination!” Truth is the best of all things&mdash;except
when it spoils business. Then it becomes “evil,”
and “shocking,” and “gives countenance to the worst
prejudices.”</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE NATIONAL VACCINE ESTABLISHMENT&mdash;1808-40.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">We shall now return to the current of our Story, nor
turn aside until it is brought to a conclusion in the enactment
of Compulsory Vaccination.</p>

<p>With £3000 a-year the National Vaccine Establishment
was constituted by the House of Commons, on 9th
June, 1808; sixty members voting for the project, and
five against.</p>

<p>The reasons for the institution were somewhat complicated.
The Royal Jennerian Society had been wrecked
by Jenner’s jealousy and intrigue. The working and
subscribing members seceded with Dr. Walker, and set
up the London Vaccine Institution; and a variety of
ornamental and influential folk, who paid little and did
less, found themselves with Jenner on their hands, exigent,
impecunious, and helpless, and they publicly committed
to the patronage and diffusion of vaccination.</p>

<p>It was an awkward situation, and two operations
for relief became necessary: first, to dispose of Jenner;
and second, to escape from the maintenance of vaccination.</p>

<p>The first was effected by inducing the House of Commons
to vote Jenner £20,000, and the second by the
institution of the National Vaccine Establishment. Thus
dexterously, fashionable and medical London contrived
to get rid of Jenner and vaccination on terms satisfactory
to all concerned.</p>

<p>The early furore for vaccination had spent itself.
Scepticism had thriven by experience. Many of the
vaccinated had taken smallpox, and explanations and excuses
were becoming exhausted. It was easy to claim
the benefit of mistakes when the operators were
amateurs; but when the failures were the work of
Jenner and his certified associates, it was hard for faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
to hold out. Spurious cowpox served to account for
many disasters; but when Jenner, pressed to define spurious
cowpox, was driven to confess its non-existence, and
that, when he had spoken of it, he had only meant any
irregular action of cowpox on the persons of the vaccinated,
it is easy to imagine how people who had respect
for themselves were pleased to drop out of the connection.
They might not care to express all they suspected, nor to
proclaim their credulity, but it was a welcome deliverance
to be no longer responsible for a practice and a
character grown so questionable. On John Bull’s broad
back was laid the burden.</p>

<p>In the project of the National Vaccine Establishment
there was an explicit concession to the scepticism of the
time. One of its purposes was alleged to be <em>Investigation</em>.
Lord Henry Petty, in recommending the measure
in the House of Commons, observed&mdash;“The evidence as
to the infallible efficacy of vaccination is confessedly incomplete;
and it is highly desirable that the truth should
be ascertained by public inquiry, rather than by societies
whose conductors are liable to the imputation of mercenary
motives.” Jenner bitterly resented the indignity
implied in placing vaccination under investigation. He
held, and in a sense justly, that it was too late to speak
of investigation when the reality of his discovery had
been attested in the public honours and rewards conferred
upon him. “Alas!” he exclaimed, “poor Vaccinia,
how art thou degraded!” He was still further outraged
by his exclusion from the Board of the Establishment, on
the ground that the public might have assurance of impartiality.
How much sincerity there was in the profession,
I do not pretend to divine; it is sufficient to point
out that matters had come to such a pass with vaccination
that it was considered expedient to conciliate the
taxpayers with the promise of inquiry for their money.
Plainly the enthusiastic certainty of 1802 had given
place to a widely different sentiment in 1808.</p>

<p>There were, however, wheels within wheels. “You may
take it for granted,” said a Radical of those days, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
every vote of public money has an object in excess of the
ostensible one, and covers jobs big or jobs little.” And
so it was in the case before us. The discomfited residue
of the Royal Jennerian Society had influence with the
Government to take over their smashed-up enterprise;
but their solicitation might have been ineffectual, had
not the Government seen a way of providing for a certain
claimant in the course of the operation. Sir John Moore
was serving his country in the Peninsula; he had friends
at the sources of power; and he had a brother named
James, surgeon to the Life Guards, for whom a comfortable
berth was wanted. Let us make Moore, they said,
Director of this new Establishment, with a salary of
£200 a-year; and the thing was done. Investigation
was promised, Cowpox was endowed, and Moore was
provided for.</p>

<p>Jenner had actively promoted the formation of the
Establishment, under the conviction that he should be its
governor; but when the organisation was revealed, he
was profoundly disgusted. The management was assigned
to a Board of eight members, consisting of the
president and four censors of the College of Physicians,
and the master and two governors of the College of Surgeons,
with salaries of £100 a-year apiece. From this
Board, as stated, Jenner was deliberately excluded, “so
as to ensure impartial investigation.” It was at first
proposed to hold Jenner subordinate to the Board, giving
him the title of Director, with Moore as his working
deputy; for it was clearly recognised by those who had
had experience of him during his London career, that for
regular duty he was good for nothing; and that with his
sickly family resident in Gloucestershire, he was never to
be reckoned upon for a day. When, however, the Board
disregarded his nominations, especially that of his bully,
John Ring, as “Principal Vaccinator and Inspector of
Stations,” he at once severed his connection with the
Establishment; “since,” in his own words, “he found
that he was to have nothing to do, and that his office
was only a name.” “My not being a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
British Vaccine Establishment will,” he wrote, “astonish
the world; and no one in it can be more astonished than
myself”; but so far as can be discerned, the astonishment
was chiefly limited to himself. Evanescent and
futile is the astonishment of the world under most circumstances,
and had the public opinion of the time been
consulted, there is little doubt that it would have gone
with the Board against Jenner.</p>

<p>Moore was, therefore, promoted to Jenner’s place as
Director of the National Vaccine Establishment, in subordination
to the Board of Physicians and Surgeons.
Seven stations, with seven superintendent surgeons, were
opened in London for vaccinating all who should apply,
and for collecting and distributing virus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At first [writes Moore] the applicants for Vaccination at the
various stations were not numerous, not amounting to 3,000 a
year; but, by continued exertions, and the declension of prejudice,
the numbers regularly increased, and 7,771 persons were vaccinated
in London in the year 1816.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p></div>

<p>These numbers are significant, as indicating the extent
of the collapse of vaccination, and how little the continuous
decline of smallpox in London was due to its
extension.</p>

<p>Moore was a shrewd tactician. He had the sense to
recognise that if there was anything in vaccination, it
was folly to stand at variance with Jenner; and by persuading
him that he exaggerated the offence implied in
the policy of the Board, he gradually soothed his feelings
and led him into a long and confidential correspondence.
Jenner, on his side, finding that nothing resulted from
his sulks, relaxed, and from time to time favoured the
Board with the light of his countenance and counsels.</p>

<p>The national endowment of vaccination affected prejudicially
all other enterprises in the same line. What
remained of the Royal Jennerian Society withered up,
and the conductors of the London Vaccine Institution
found the collection of subscriptions almost impossible.
It was naturally objected by those solicited, “Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
we be asked to subscribe for what Government has
already provided?” But with Dr. John Walker, the
director of the London Institution, vaccination was a
fanaticism, and he was ready to live on bread and water
rather than withdraw from the promotion of what he
was persuaded was a work of salvation. He therefore
struggled on, in spite of discouragement and petty means,
and as the inability of the Government Establishment
to meet demands became manifest, whether from excess
of dignity or apathy, the Quaker Institution, as it was
called, began to thrive, to acquire the confidence alike
of the medical profession and the public, and to rival in
business the Establishment itself.</p>

<p>As for the investigation promised in the House of Commons,
it was never even attempted. Jenner’s anxiety
was superfluous. When a case of smallpox, or injury, or
death after vaccination was reported, it was the recognised
formula to assert either some defect in the operation,
or the virus, or some cause, or any cause <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab extra</i> rather
than allow the Jennerian principle to suffer. As an
illustration of the procedure of the Board in this respect,
we have the instance of Mr. Thomas Brown, surgeon,
Musselburgh, as served up in Moore’s insolence&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Vaccine was in two years spread over Scotland. After a
time, however, one croaking voice was raised to disturb the general
concord. Mr. Brown, who was fretting in obscurity at Musselburgh,
published a book in 1809 to maintain that the Vaccine only
possessed the property of preventing Smallpox temporarily; that
in three years its influence declined; and in five or six, hardly any
security against Smallpox remained.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Brown submitted his cases to the Board, but they met
with no attention.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this extremity [continues Moore] he wrote a scurrilous accusation
of the National Vaccine Establishment to the Secretary of
State, which was referred to the Board. When they met, the
Registrar read it, and then tied it up with red tape among that
mass of papers which are consigned to rest.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p></div>

<p class="noindent">Could more be expressed in less? Thus was Brown, the
representative of true science and enlightened and honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
inquiry, set at naught and traduced by a Board endowed
for investigation! Nor, in saying so, do I speak simply
as an antagonist of vaccination. Brown was no anti-vaccinist.
What he contended for is now everywhere
admitted by vaccinists. They allow that the protection
afforded by vaccination is temporary, and that it is
necessary to renew its prophylaxy from time to time.
The practice of revaccination is based on the verity of
Brown’s contention, and yet, according to Moore, he was
a vain-glorious and scurrilous fellow, and by Jenner
was pronounced “an object of commiseration rather than
resentment.”</p>

<p>As purveyors of virus, too, the Establishment fell
behind Walker’s Institution, and the Quakers’ pox had
the preference among connoisseurs in the article. Jenner
wrote to Moore, 5th March, 1816&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Matter sent out by the National Vaccine Establishment is
much complained of. I was applied to a few weeks since by the
surgeons of the hospital at Gloucester for some Vaccine Matter,
and their request was accompanied by the observation, “That
after using thirty points sent from town, not a single pustule was
produced.”</p></div>

<p>To account for such failures, it began to be reported
that the virus was gradually losing its virtue in transit
through many arms; but, continued Jenner&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Medical men are more expert than others in discovering causes
without the fatigue of much thinking, and in the present instance
they have all hit upon the wrong one&mdash;no great wonder. They
attribute the lessened activity of the Matter, and its disposition to
produce imperfect vesicles, to the great length of time which has
elapsed since it was taken from the cow, and to the immense
number of human subjects through whom it has passed. This is a
conjecture, and I can destroy it by facts. The Matter may undergo
a change that may render it unfit for further use by passing even
from one individual to another; and this was as likely to happen
in the first year of Vaccination as the twentieth. There are medical
men who will take anything they can catch under the mere name
of Vaccine Matter, or from pustules incorrect in character. It is
from the spread of such Matter that the dissatisfaction of which I
speak has arisen.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>When we refer to the record of the National Vaccine
Establishment, there is little reason for surprise over its
inefficiency. The House of Commons, having voted the
endowment of £3,000 a-year, the Government committed
the organisation of the Establishment and the administration
of its funds to the heads of the Royal College of
Physicians. How the £3,000 a-year was disposed of,
came to light in 1822, when the accounts were published.
The statement stood thus for 1821, representing what
had gone on during the past twelve years&mdash;</p>

<p>The accounts, though they revealed what was suspected,
were widely denounced as scandalous. Parliament voted
£3,000 a-year to extend vaccination among the poor, and
here were a set of physicians and surgeons pocketing
£800 of it, and muddling away the greater part of the
remainder. They affected to regard vaccination as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
deliverance of mankind from the scourge of smallpox,
and yet they had not hesitated to appropriate the means
provided for its diffusion! There was scarcely the pretence
of work for wages. The Board met once a week,
but the attendance was irregular, and at each member’s
discretion. The eight hundred-a-yearers dropped in when
convenient for gossip, and to ask what was doing. When
set upon their defence, the argument was that the public
were distrustful of vaccination, and that to inspire confidence
it was necessary that the Establishment should
have the benefit of the ostensible support of the College of
Physicians and the College of Surgeons, for which the
honorarium of £100 annually to each of their representatives
was by no means excessive. In reply, it was pointed
out that Dr. Walker, supported by voluntary contributions,
collected with difficulty, and with less than the pay of many
an artizan, had done more for vaccination in London and
the country, and was more respected and trusted, than the
Establishment with all the prestige of corporate authority.</p>

<p>As the result of many protests, the waste of public
money was brought before the House of Commons by
Joseph Hume. It was Mr. Hume’s distinction that, with
strong good sense and invincible patience, he upheld the
standard of honesty in public finance, holding that it
was as wrong to defraud the nation as to defraud an
individual; and that it was as foolish (not to say more
wicked) to pay away the people’s money for nothing, as
to throw away one’s own. The principle, so obviously
indisputable, and yet so shamelessly violated in every
department of the State, was enforced in detail by Mr.
Hume with a persistency and success that has never been
surpassed, and, I fear, never appreciated as deserved. He
showed that patriotism is a practical virtue, instead of a
sentimental pretext for public plunder, and taught honour
to placemen to whom honour was unknown. Appropriately,
therefore, Mr. Hume led the charge against the
National Vaccine Establishment, and in 1827 the annual
vote was reduced from £3,000 to £2,500, £300 of the
£500 being saved by knocking off two useless physicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
and one useless surgeon. Even then the extravagance
that remained continued to excite indignation, the consequences
of which are recorded in a “Report from the
Select Committee on the Vaccine Board, with the Minutes
of Evidence, ordered by the House of Commons to be
printed, 28th August, 1833.” If space allowed, it would
be easy to linger over the disclosures of this Committee.
Suffice it to say, that Dr. George Gregory, of the Smallpox
Hospital, held that the whole work of the Board
might be done handsomely on £1,200 a-year. The Committee,
however, shrank from such a severe exercise of
economy, and recommended the provision of the following
staff and expenses&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>The Committee observed that the Board might consist
of two physicians and one surgeon, whose duties, not
being onerous, might be discharged gratuitously. As the
Committee was more loose-handed than Dr. Gregory, so
the Commons were laxer than the Committee. The
President and a Censor of the College of Physicians, and
the President of the College of Surgeons, were suffered
to continue their £100 a-year each, and the annual subsidy
for the Establishment stood fixed at £2,200, until
vaccination, under the disguise of sanitation, developed
into the monstrous proportions with which we are at
this day afflicted.</p>

<p>There is much talk prevalent in favour of “the endowment
of research;” but what may come of such endowment,
when not sharply looked after, is manifest in the
example of the National Vaccine Establishment. The
investigation, assumed to start with, was never pursued;
and the guardianship of the public interest undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
by the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons was never
anything but make-believe. Annual Reports were presented
to Parliament, signed by the heads of the Establishment,
but of research they bore no trace, and many
of them might have been dashed off by the Registrar in
the course of an hour. Destitute of any scientific merit,
these reports yet afford some curious glimpses of what
was going on from year to year, with indications of the
chief points of resistance encountered by the practice of
vaccination; and, in turning over the series from 1810
to 1840, I have made the following notes, which may
be read, perhaps, with interest.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">VARIOLATION.</h4>

<p>The chief resistance proceeded from the inoculators
with smallpox; indeed, with the exception of apathy,
there might be said to be no other resistance. Hence we
read under the several dates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1810.&mdash;During 1809, the surgeons vaccinated 1,493 persons. We
are sorry to have to relate a decline of Vaccination in the Metropolis,
and an apparent indisposition to the practice of it; and to
express regret that there should be evil-disposed persons, who are
endeavouring to frustrate His Majesty’s intentions by alarming
the misinformed with stories which they know to be false.</p>

<p>1812.&mdash;We have reason to ascribe the increase of Smallpox in
London during last year to the rash and inconsiderate manner in
which great numbers are still inoculated for the Smallpox, and
afterwards required to attend two or three times a week at the
place of inoculation in every stage of their illness. The practice of
Inoculation is the great means whereby Smallpox is kept in existence,
and its infection propagated to persons and places where it
would not otherwise be seen.</p>

<p>1814.&mdash;The Board has with great regret to observe that, although
the punishment of three months’ imprisonment was awarded against
Sophia Vantandillo, for carrying her child, whilst under the influence
of Smallpox, through the streets, (which infected many others,
eight of whom died) the unwary are still enticed by the hand-bills
of shameless empirics to submit their children to Variolous Inoculation.
It is, however, to be hoped that the above sentence passed
by the Court of King’s Bench, which the Board has taken every
method of promulgating, may produce considerable benefit. The
Board selected Sophia Vantandillo as a proper example on account
of the extent of the mischief occasioned by her misconduct; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
that this prosecution, followed by a lenient punishment, may
prevent any further wilful exposure of inoculated persons, is its
fervent wish. The Board at the same time prosecuted Mr. Burnet,
who inoculated the child, and who has long circulated most mischievous
and offensive hand-bills, offering to inoculate persons with
Smallpox gratis, and stigmatising Vaccination as productive of the
most loathsome disease. This practitioner having suffered judgment
to go by default, has been sentenced by the Court of King’s
Bench to six months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>The whole of the expenses incident to this Establishment for
1814 have been defrayed by the vote of last year, but the Board
regrets that in consequence of the recent prosecutions and convictions,
and the measures adopted for the more effectual extension
of the practice of vaccination throughout the Empire, an addition
of £500 to the annual grant will be necessary.</p>

<p>1815.&mdash;In Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Norwich, Inoculation is
disused, and, in consequence, the Smallpox is scarcely known. In
the country about Aberystwith in Wales, and Bawtry in Yorkshire,
it has entirely disappeared. The reverse is, unhappily, the
case in Portsmouth, Bristol, and London. In the Metropolis alone
the mortality may be estimated at 1,000 annually; perhaps throughout
the United Kingdom it is not less than ten times that number.
It appears to us that this waste of human life can be prevented
only by such legislative enactments as will entirely put a stop to
Inoculation with Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>That smallpox was increased by variolation we have
no reason to doubt, notwithstanding the fact that toward
the close of the last century, when variolation was most
practised, smallpox was steadily falling-off; but to ascribe
the existence and persistence of smallpox to variolation
was absurd. Smallpox was a widely-diffused disease
before variolation was introduced to anticipate and minimise
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1817.&mdash;The pernicious practice of Smallpox Inoculation, now
very generally relinquished by the medical profession, is only
persisted in by a very few of the least creditable class of practitioners,
and is usually carried on clandestinely; yet the Board are
concerned to state that this destructive operation is now performed
for gain by itinerant Empirics, Farriers, Publicans, Nurses, low,
cunning people of both sexes, and of various descriptions. And
such is the infatuation of the poor and ignorant, that many of them
carry their infants to be inoculated by those who only know how
to inflict, but not how to assuage, the violence of Smallpox. The
consequence has been that many have perished under their management;
and the disease in particular districts has been widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
disseminated. As this iniquitous conduct has prevailed much in
London, an epidemic of Smallpox was last year excited among
those who were not secured by Vaccination, and 1,051 persons
died of the disease.</p>

<p>1836.&mdash;Only 300 died of Smallpox in London in the course of
last year; and it is probable that this mortality, however comparatively
small, is owing to the continued partial practice of Inoculation,
which is liable to disseminate far and wide its contagious influence,
to the imminent danger of all who have not been protected by
previous Vaccination, or by having had Smallpox already.</p></div>

<p>Variolation was made a penal offence in 1840, and
became less available as an excuse for the persistence of
smallpox in defiance of vaccination.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">FAILURE OF VACCINATION.</h4>

<p>Accepting Jenner’s revelation, the heads of the medical
profession in London assured the public, in a manifesto
in 1800, that “those persons who have had Cowpox are
perfectly secure from the future infection of Smallpox.”
It was a rash assertion. Proofs of its untruth were not
slow to appear. At first they were denied, then explained
away, and then admitted under qualifications more or
less adroit. When, in 1808, the National Vaccine Establishment
was constituted, the fact of the failure of Vaccination
to answer to its original promise was generally
recognised. Nevertheless, the reports of the Establishment
exhibit much ingenious wriggling and attempts to
out-lie Nature. For example&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1811.&mdash;That in some instances Smallpox has affected persons
who have been most carefully vaccinated, is sufficiently established;
nor ought we to be surprised at this, when we consider that Inoculation
for Smallpox sometimes fails, and that several cases may be
produced in which persons have been affected with the natural
disease more than once in the course of life. The Board have
infinite satisfaction in stating the two following important and
decisive facts in proof of the efficacy and safety of Vaccination,
namely, that in the cases which have come to their knowledge,
Smallpox after Vaccination, with a very few exceptions, has been
a mild disease, and that out of the many hundred thousand persons
Vaccinated, not a single authenticated instance has been communicated
to them of the occurrence of fatal Smallpox after
Vaccination.</p>

<p>The Board have great pleasure in stating that the money granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
by Parliament during the last session has been sufficient to defray
the expenses of the year 1811, and they are of opinion that the
same sum will be adequate to the expenditure of the current year.</p></div>

<p>There were 3,148 vaccinations effected under the Board
in 1811, which was at the rate of about £1 a-head.</p>

<p>Moore, after reporting some cases of smallpox after
vaccination, at St. Osyth, in Essex, went on to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1816.&mdash;Some very rare instances of failures in Vaccination, as
exceptions to a general law, may be expected as long as Smallpox
is prevalent; since it has been fully ascertained that when the air
is strongly impregnated with the infectious vapour of Smallpox,
some of those who have had the disease are attacked a second time.</p>

<p>1818.&mdash;From the foundation of this Establishment in 1808 to the
present year there have been vaccinated 52,253 persons at the
stations in London. Only four of these are yet known to have had
Smallpox afterwards, and these were never very seriously ill.</p>

<p>1819.&mdash;The testimonies of some of our correspondents concur in
showing that great numbers of persons who had been vaccinated
have been subsequently seized with a disease presenting all the
essential characters of Smallpox; but that in the great majority of
such cases, the disease has been of comparatively short duration,
unattended by symptoms of danger. In several of these cases,
however, the malady has been prolonged to its ordinary period,
and in eight reported cases it has proved fatal. It appears to us
to be fairly established that the disposition in the vaccinated to be
thus affected by the contagion of Smallpox does not depend upon
the time that has elapsed after Vaccination, since some persons
have been so affected who had recently been vaccinated, whilst
others who had been vaccinated eighteen and twenty years have
been variolated, and exposed to contagion with impunity.</p>

<p>1820.&mdash;It is true that we have received accounts from different
parts of the country of numerous cases of Smallpox having occurred
after Vaccination, and we cannot doubt that the prejudices of the
people against this preventive are assignable (and not altogether
unreasonably, perhaps) to this cause. These cases the Board have
industriously investigated, and though it appears that many of
them rest only on hearsay evidence, and that others seem to have
undergone the Vaccine Process imperfectly, yet after every reasonable
deduction, we are compelled to allow that too many still
remain on undeniable proof to leave any doubt that the pretensions
of Vaccination, to the merit of a perfect and exclusive security in
all cases against Smallpox, were at first admitted too unreservedly.</p>

<p>1825.&mdash;That a considerable number of persons have had Smallpox
after having been vaccinated, we are ready to admit; although
of cases of this kind, a large majority are found on examination
to be without that test of the operation being performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
successfully and effectually, which all agree to be necessary to
perfect security. Vaccination, therefore, it will be said, does not
afford an absolute and perfect security. We do not present it to
the world with that pretension, but we declare it to be the least
imperfect of the resources we possess for encountering the disease.</p>

<p>1827.&mdash;It is true, cases are reported to us very often of the
occurrence of Smallpox after Vaccination; but we have reason to
believe that the number of those who fall into this safe, though
sometimes severe disease, after Vaccination, is not greater than
that of those who formerly <em>died</em> by Inoculation whilst that practice
prevailed.</p>

<p>1833.&mdash;Of an equal number of persons vaccinated and variolated,
only so many of the former will be capable of taking the Smallpox
afterwards, and that in a safe degree of the disease, as are found
to die by the latter.</p>

<p>1836.&mdash;If 300 children be vaccinated, one will be susceptible of
Smallpox afterwards, but only in a mild and perfectly safe form,
whereas if 300 be variolated, one will surely die.</p></div>

<p>As evolutions from inner consciousness, the statistics
of Variolation and Vaccination under 1827, 1833, and
1836 are noteworthy. They illustrate the facility of the
Board at the discovery of what was thought <em>ought to be
true</em>.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">DEVELOPMENT OF A FABULOUS SALVATION.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1811.&mdash;Previous to the discovery of Vaccination, the average
number of deaths by Smallpox within the London bills of mortality
was 2,000 annually; whereas during 1811, only 751 died of the
disease, notwithstanding the increase of population.</p>

<p>1818.&mdash;During the year, 6,289 have been vaccinated in London
and the vicinity; and the Board have much satisfaction in adducing
unequivocal evidence of the increasing advantages of the Jennerian
discovery; for it appears from the bills of mortality of London
that, instead of 2,000 deaths by Smallpox, which was the annual
average previous to the practice of Vaccination, there died in 1818
only 421.</p></div>

<p>That, previous to the introduction of vaccination, 2,000
was the average annual death-rate from smallpox in
London is a statement that requires definition. At an
early date the number is under the mark, and at a later
it is over the mark. Dr. Farr delivers the truth in these
words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after Inoculation was
introduced. The annual deaths from Smallpox in London, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
1760 to 1779, were on an average 2,323. In the next twenty years,
1780 to 1799, they declined to 1,740. The disease, therefore, began
to grow less fatal before Vaccination was discovered, indicating,
together with the diminution of fevers, the general improvement
of health then taking place.</p></div>

<p>Bearing Dr. Farr’s figures in mind (and not forgetting
the 2,000 adduced by the Board in the reports for 1811
and 1818), what does the reader think of the following
audacious attempts on public credulity?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1826.&mdash;From the quantity of vaccine lymph distributed, we are
led to presume the practice of Vaccination is becoming daily more
general; and the inference is still further confirmed by the fact
that in 1826, only 503 deaths have occurred from Smallpox within
the bills of mortality; whereas in the preceding year, 1,299 persons
are recorded as having fallen victims to the loathsome disease.
The whole of this difference ought not, perhaps, in candour to be
attributed to the influence of Vaccination; for Smallpox during
1825 assumed a peculiarly malignant character; and there were
more instances of the distemper occurring twice in the same individual
than had ever been reported to us before. But when we
reflect that before the introduction of Vaccination the average
number of deaths from Smallpox in London was annually about
4,000, no stronger argument can reasonably be demanded in favour
of the value of this important discovery. Nor can any more striking
proof be given of the paternal care of the Government to protect
the people at home and abroad from this destructive disease than
the establishment and maintenance of this Board.</p></div>

<p>The bouncing falsehood, having passed muster, was
repeated with enlargement at a suitable interval&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1834.&mdash;Only 334 deaths by Smallpox have been reported, a
number considerably less than have died in any year since the
introduction of Vaccination, and falling short by at least 4,000 of
the average of deaths annually by Smallpox in London before the
protecting influence of Cowpox was discovered and promulgated.</p></div>

<p>And again it appeared with a fresh touch of exaggeration&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1836.&mdash;The annual loss of life by Smallpox in the Metropolis
before Vaccination was established exceeded 5,000, whereas, in the
course of last year, only 300 died of the distemper.</p></div>

<p>Impunity being apparently assured, the fable came to
be delivered as matter-of-course, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1839.&mdash;Formerly 5,000 died annually of Smallpox within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
London bills of mortality; but since Vaccination superseded
Variolation, the number has gradually decreased, until it amounted
to only 200 in the year 1837. In the course of the year that has
terminated (during which Smallpox prevailed epidemically), there
died 800; not one more, after all, than one-sixth of the number
who died annually [that is to say, 4,800] during the prevalence of
Variolation, notwithstanding the increased population of London
and its environs. By a careful retrospect, we are, therefore,
justified in stating that 4,000 lives are saved every year in London,
since Vaccination so largely superseded Variolation.</p></div>

<p>The fall in smallpox that set in toward the close of
last century was not confined to London, but extended
to many European populations. It began before vaccination
was heard of, and continued independently of it,
though the vaccinators eagerly claimed the phenomenon
as the result of their superfluous efforts. The claim was
absurd as concerned London, for it plainly appears that
vaccination during the years in question never overtook,
or even approached, the metropolitan birth-rate. Here
is the record of the vaccinations effected by the Establishment
in five years&mdash;</p>

<p>The entire vaccinations in five years not equalling the
London births in any one year! There were, we dare
say, as many more vaccinated by voluntary effort; but
the figures, however extended, cannot be got to cover
the immense mass of lower-class Londoners, who then,
as now, were the chief factors of smallpox. What I say
emphatically is, the National Vaccine Establishment
had as much influence on London smallpox as the Holy
Alliance.</p>


<h4 class="no-brk">POCK-MARKED FACES.</h4>

<p>One of the arguments for vaccination at this day runs
thus&mdash;“How do you account for the absence of pock-marked
faces? When I was young, forty years ago,
nothing was commoner than countenances disfigured by
smallpox.” Occasionally the reminiscence <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'is tranferred to'">is transferred
to</ins> a mother or grandmother, who is reported to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
said that she remembered when every third or fourth
person was pitted.</p>

<p>We need not take seriously the motherly or grand-motherly
reminiscences, so apt to be touched with the
glamour of years. Confining ourselves to living memories,
the owners thereof may, perhaps, be surprised to learn
that the transformation for which they personally avouch
was effected before they were born, or were qualified observers;
and before vaccination was sufficiently practised
to have wrought the change; and here is the evidence, as
set forth in the reports of the National Vaccine Establishment,
and printed by order of the House of Commons.
Under the following dates we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1822.&mdash;As a proof of the protecting influence of Vaccination, we
appeal confidently to all who frequent theatres and crowded
assemblies to admit that they do not discover in the rising generation
any longer that disfigurement of the human face which was
obvious everywhere some years since.</p>

<p>1825.&mdash;The deaths by Smallpox amounted to 1,299 in 1825, a
much greater number than has been reported for some years past.
From this melancholy statement it is impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the lower orders of society continue to be prejudiced
against Vaccination, and allow Smallpox to take its course.</p>

<p>And yet what argument more powerful can be urged in favour
of Vaccination than the daily remark which the least observant
must make, that in our churches, our theatres, and in every large
assemblage of the people, to see a young person bearing the marks
of Smallpox is now of extremely rare occurrence.</p>

<p>To what can the freedom from the vestiges of so loathsome a
disease be attributed, but to the protecting influence of Vaccination?
for Variolation has now been disused by all respectable
practitioners for some time past.</p>

<p>1837.&mdash;The rarity of an example of disfigurement by Smallpox
now to be found in the theatres, in churches, or in any large
assemblage of the people, affords proof that Vaccination has lost
none of its efficacy.</p></div>

<p>Pock-marked faces are by no means uncommon at this
day in London, though their number has diminished
through more careful nursing and the use of well-known
means for preventing disfigurement; and whoever cares
to pursue the inquiry will discover that the majority
of the marked have been vaccinated and many re-vaccinated&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
proof that it is not the rite which prevents
the scars.</p>

<p>The general impression we derive from the reports of
the Establishment, 1808-40, is that they proceeded from
men who were committed to vaccination, but had no
profound faith in its efficacy; who were averse from the
admission of its impotence, and ultimately held by it
as possibly the best available defence against smallpox.
With ample means and opportunities for investigation,
they made no discovery, nor achieved any advance in
practice, nor apparently conceived that there was either
discovery or advance to be made. They accepted smallpox
as a mysterious ordinance of Nature, with cowpox
for a probable antidote, and there stuck fast, thoughtless
and helpless. They did not even observe that smallpox
was specially a disease of the young and the poor, nor
deduce conclusions therefrom. They had their money,
and went through an appropriate routine, and there their
action ended.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE NATIONAL VACCINE ESTABLISHMENT&mdash;1841-50.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Along with the prohibition of Variolous Inoculation in
1840, Parliament passed an Act for the provision of
Vaccination out of the poor-rate. A scheme had been
formulated and petitioned for by the Provincial Medical
and Surgical Association in 1838, with the expectation that
the Government might be induced to create a multitude
of places for “regularly educated vaccinators, with suitable
salaries, in districts sufficiently numerous to embrace
the whole of the poor population of the country.” The
House of Commons being of a thrifty turn in those days,
did not however favour such a magnificent development
of place and pay under the National Vaccine Establishment,
and disposed of the project by referring the
provision of vaccination to the parochial authorities, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
might be trusted to do what was needful with due regard
to economy. In every union, and in every parish
that was not in union, it was provided that there should
be one or more medical practitioners appointed by the
Guardians for the gratuitous vaccination of the inhabitants,
with remuneration from the rates according to the
number operated upon.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This accession to their burdens
met with anything but welcome from the ratepayers in
general. Contracts for vaccination at so much per head
were submitted for competition, and those who accepted
the rite at the public expense were spoken of as paupers,
and in some places had their names published to “shame
them.” To remove the stigma of pauperism from the
parish prophylaxy, an Act was passed in 1841 in which
it was declared that public vaccination was not of the
nature of “parochial relief, alms, or charitable allowance,”
and did not therefore deprive the recipient of any “right
or privilege,” or subject him “to any disability or disqualification
whatsoever.”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The reports of the National Vaccine Establishment
from 1841 to 1850 continued to be of the same perfunctory
character. They usually started with a profession
of confidence in vaccination, after the fashion of
Mrs. Micawber’s resolution never to desert Micawber;
the signature to which declaration by the President and
Senior Censor of the Royal College of Physicians, and
the President of the Royal College of Surgeons being
accompanied with a douceur of £100 to each. For example,
we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1841.&mdash;Smallpox has prevailed epidemically with considerable
severity since our last Report; but we do not abate an iota of our
confidence in Vaccination as the best protective against its malignant
influence.</p>

<p>1845.&mdash;The unabated confidence with which we continue to regard
Vaccination, etc., etc.</p>

<p>1847.&mdash;Nothing has occurred to diminish our confidence in the
protective influence of Vaccination. It is true that Smallpox has
now and then reappeared; and lately to an extent which has called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
for additional efforts on the part of all the officers of the Establishment;
but we regard such recurrence as due to the ordinary
operations of those periodical influences which give to the disease
its epidemic character; and in some localities, as in Ireland, to that
distress with which contagious diseases are so invariably associated.</p></div>

<p>The reporters apparently forgot that according to the
doctrine of which they were the representatives, vaccination
excluded the possibility of smallpox under whatever
circumstances of atmosphere, filth, or privation. If
only effective in the absence of the ordinary conditions of
smallpox, wherein consisted the benefit of the rite?</p>

<p>Ceely of Aylesbury in 1839, and Badcock of Brighton
in 1840, succeeded in inoculating cows with smallpox,
and the resulting virus was described as cowpox, and
used for vaccination far and wide. Apparently the procedure
was not approved by the Vaccine Establishment,
for we read in the report&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1841.&mdash;The matter we employ is obtained by succession from
the original virus communicated by Dr. Jenner himself, and that
we find is as effectual as ever. We may be excused therefore, we
hope, if we discourage an incautious dissemination of matter
obtained from new sources, which has not stood the test of ample
experience.</p></div>

<p>The original virus communicated by Jenner himself!
What was it? When the National Vaccine Establishment
was instituted in 1808, the virus in circulation in
London was accepted as stock, and it certainly had
several origins. It was cowpox as discovered by Pearson;
it was horsegrease cowpox and horsepox as derived from
Jenner; and there is reason to believe it was smallpox
from Woodville and others. The claim, therefore, to the
possession of a specific variety of matter communicated
by Jenner was fictitious.</p>

<p>Again, through the recurrent failure of vaccination to
avert smallpox, the Board had to discountenance the
assertion that their virus had lost its virtue through
prolonged transmission&mdash;a reason which led some to
prefer the fresh variolous stocks of Ceely and Badcock&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1840.&mdash;The experience of another year has afforded proofs of the
propriety, in the present state of our knowledge, of preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
Vaccine Matter, the produce of the original virus furnished by Dr.
Jenner, which has now passed happily through successive generations
of subjects in the course of 43 years, and which forms the
principal source of our supply, to any which may have been
recently taken from the cow.</p></div>

<p>Here we have “the original virus furnished by Dr.
Jenner” set forth as no more than “the <em>principal</em> source
of supply.” The reports are characterised by many
similar inconsistencies&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1845.&mdash;We regard as erroneous the belief that Vaccine Virus
undergoes deterioration by being kept; in proof of which we are
prepared to establish, by unquestionable documents, the striking
fact, that Lymph which had been conveyed to and from India has
retained its protective properties wholly unimpaired after a lapse
of 20 years.</p></div>

<p>Another vexation of the Board was due to the assertion
that the protective virtues of vaccination gradually
wore out, and that the repetition of the rite was necessary
for the maintenance of salvation. In the <cite>London
Medical Gazette</cite>, 2nd August, 1844, it was proclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are sorry to announce the extensive prevalence of Smallpox
at this time among us. <span class="smcap">Revaccinate, Revaccinate</span>, say we.</p></div>

<p>Such advice was essentially heretical and damnable;
for Jenner affirmed and maintained&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of
the genuine Cowpox, is never afterwards, at any period of its
existence, assailable by Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>If revaccination were possible, smallpox after vaccination
was possible; and if so much were conceded, on what
ground was vaccination to be defended? Whatever the
facts, the members of the Board resolved to stand loyally
by the primitive Jennerian doctrine, and in their Report
for 1851 thus testified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It may be expedient to remind the public of the established fact
which the Board upon former occasions anxiously insisted upon,
that the restriction of the protective power of Vaccination to any
age, or to any term of years, is an hypothesis contradicted by experience,
and wholly unsupported by analogy.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the prohibition of Variolous Inoculation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the Board had repeatedly to deplore its continuance
especially in Ireland. Thus we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1850.&mdash;The Board again entreat the attention of the Government
to the fact that Inoculation for the Smallpox still continues;
and that the disease is communicated by vagrants to those unprotected
by Vaccination in town and country. The contagion is
carried throughout the land by wandering Irish, and no care, however
great, can be successful in eradicating Smallpox, whilst the
neglect of Vaccination and the practice of Variolous Inoculation
are permitted in Ireland.</p></div>

<p>It was Jenner’s practice to attribute to wilful blindness
and innate depravity any scepticism as to the
efficacy of vaccination; and throughout the Reports of
the Establishment this habit of imputation was maintained.
Vaccination was treated as a sort of divine
revelation, plenary and manifest, which could only be
disputed or resisted from deliberate perversity, or, more
charitably, from abject dulness or ignorance; and it
would be easy to construct a catena of piquant deliverances
under this semi-theological persuasion. Such
observations as the following were of the order of matter-of-course&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1850.&mdash;We regret to learn that in our own country the spread of
Vaccination is still materially impeded by influences emanating
from ignorance and prejudice in the lower orders, and from prejudices
in many who cannot plead the excuse of ignorance.</p>

<p>1851.&mdash;It is lamentable to observe not only the indifference, but
the active hostility displayed by the community to Vaccination.
Deeply-rooted prejudices and absurd superstitions are ever opposing
its adoption.</p></div>

<p>The Reports of the Establishment year after year
displayed in full measure the familiar complacency of
official routine&mdash;where pay is constant and wheels propelled
from office desks revolve smoothly in space&mdash;so
many Londoners vaccinated, so many charges of virus
distributed, and confidence in the sacred prophylactic
unabated. A revolution was, however, impending. The
attitude of the public mind toward disease had become
transformed. Faith in sanitation as a preventive of
fevers had been created, and a popular demand for sanitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
improvement had set in. Under cover of this new
enthusiasm some of the shrewder advocates of vaccination
conjectured that it would be possible to effect its endowment
and establishment on a scale hitherto unattempted
in England. It was true that vaccination had no relation
to sanitation; but the reforming and philanthropic mob
were madly in favour of whatever bore the promise of
health, and were not likely to show themselves hypercritical
or obstructive.</p>

<p>The first movement toward a new advance is discernible
in the Report of the Establishment for 1850 wherein
we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Board have had to solicit the attention of Her Majesty’s
Government on several occasions to the deplorable fact that a very
large proportion of the children of the poorer classes in the Metropolis,
and in England and Wales generally, but above all in Ireland,
remain year by year without the benefit of Vaccination. Their
testimony on this important part of the sanitary condition of the
population has been derived from the reports of numerous competent
medical witnesses in all parts of the United Kingdom, and
from the frequent recurrence of rapid and fatal invasions of Smallpox,
to which their attention has been repeatedly called by urgent
applications for Vaccine Lymph. It is satisfactory to find that the
representations which the Board have made are most unequivocally
confirmed by the report of Mr. Grainger, from which it appears
that the number of persons under one year who were vaccinated
during the year ended 29th September, 1848, in 627 Unions of
parishes in England and Wales (exclusive of those vaccinated at
the cost of their parents) amounted to no more than 33 per cent.,
compared with the total number of births registered in the same
period.</p></div>

<p>These figures are worth noting. Dating from 1840,
an effort was made to overtake the vaccination of the
people by the agency of the poor law; and yet so late as
1848, not more than one-third of the children born were
accounted for as Jennerised. Adding to this third the
offspring of the upper and middle classes, we may safely
conclude that up to 1850 not half the inhabitants of
England and Wales were vaccinated; and the unvaccinated
half included the lower classes most subject to
smallpox&mdash;victims of that “distress with which contagious
diseases are so invariably associated,” to cite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
words of the Report for 1847. The point is especially
worth noting because the decline of smallpox, which set
in last century, is continually ascribed to vaccination.
A true cause however must be commensurate with the
effect; and yet here we see the asserted cause of the fall
in smallpox did not apply in 1848 to half the English
people; in which half, moreover, lay nine-tenths of the
field in which smallpox was possible. The Report for
1850 continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Board lament that they have no means of adopting or enforcing
such measures as are obviously necessary for the prevention
of Smallpox. They have no power of instituting domiciliary
visits, or house to house visitation; and indeed hitherto such have
been deemed too much of an encroachment on the liberty of the
subject. They have no power to punish officially the practice of
illegal Inoculation, or the exposure of infected persons; and they
have only had the means granted to them of prosecuting such
offenders in two cases, in order to establish the fact of the illegality
of Variolous Inoculation. They can only recommend and aid, but
they cannot enforce Vaccination.</p>

<p>The progress of Vaccination is more rapid in Foreign Countries
where municipal measures or legislative enactments are adopted to
promote its dissemination; and they beg to express their conviction
that if England is to be free from Smallpox, the interposition of the
Legislature alone, by wise and comprehensive measures, can disarm
the Pestilence of its terrors, and realise the fond hopes and
prayers of the Friends of Humanity for its extinction.</p></div>

<p>In these observations is revealed the movement of a
new spirit&mdash;of a revived resolution to obtain for vaccination
the force of law. Similar projects had from time
to time been advanced by enthusiasts, and swept aside by
statesmen. Canning, for instance, had declared that he
could not imagine any circumstances whatever that
would induce him to consent to the compulsory infliction
of vaccination; and, at a later date, Sir Robert Peel expressed
himself to like effect, saying, “To make vaccination
compulsory, as in some despotic countries, would be
so opposite to the mental habits of the British people,
and the freedom of opinion wherein they rightly glory,
that I never could be a party to such compulsion.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Peel died in 1850, and a strong public opinion in favour
of sanitary reform had come into existence without
much scruple as to methods. Diseases, hitherto regarded
as supernatural inflictions, were traced to conditions
of life, remediable or avertible; so that the submission
and terror which sickness formerly inspired gave place
to widely different sentiments&mdash;a temper of intolerance
with illness, and a determination to extirpate its infectious
forms with those who in ignorance or wilfulness should
persist in their generation and diffusion.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">VACCINATION ENFORCED&mdash;1853.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Vaccination, it will be objected, had no connection with
sanitary reform. True: it had none; but the dull public
when possessed with a new enthusiasm is not apt to discriminate;
and those who had an interest in pushing
vaccination found their operations facilitated by the rising
faith in the preventibility of disease; their promise of
saving the country from smallpox seeming of a piece
with much else that had become credible.</p>

<p>Yet, strange to say, the credit of vaccination had never
fallen lower than prior to its enforcement. The proof is
written at large in the reports of the National Vaccine
Establishment from 1831 to 1850, which it is difficult to
peruse without perceiving them to be the testimonies of
half-hearted officials to a generation grown sceptical and
indifferent. The medical literature of the time reflects
the same uncertainty and doubt. Vaccination was admitted
to be no sure defence against smallpox: it might,
it probably did, mitigate the disease when it occurred; and,
in the absence of anything better, its practice was advisable;
but on such terms, what scope was there for its
advocacy! In the writings of Dr. George Gregory, this
scepticism is so pronounced, that he scarcely hesitates to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
recommend a reversion to inoculation with smallpox. A
like scepticism as to the virtue of vaccination with a like
disposition to return to variolous inoculation, is exhibited
by Dr. Copland in his <cite>Dictionary of Practical Medicine</cite>,
1844-58&mdash;a work of high repute, and the standard of
medical opinion for the time. In short, vaccination was
subject to general distrust; every claim made for it had
been belied; and except for its endowment by the State,
and the determination of sundry adventurers to have that
endowment enlarged, the practice would gradually have
fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>The same absence of confidence in vaccination was
conspicuous in the school of sanitary reformers. It was
of the essence of their revelation that smallpox was as
preventible as other fevers, and by the same methods. I
might, indeed, challenge any one to produce aught from
the utterances of the early apostles of sanitation in
deliberate or explicit praise of vaccination. The prescription
might not be formally condemned; it might
even be cursorily approved; but it was foreign to the
tenor of their doctrine, and its recommendation must
have died in their throats. Dr. Southwood Smith
delivered two lectures in Edinburgh in 1855 on the
Prevention of Epidemics, but of smallpox as preventible
by vaccination he said not a word. On the contrary,
this was his testimony, his all inclusive testimony&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Overcrowding we can prevent; the accumulation of filth in
towns and houses we can prevent; the supply of light, air, and
water, together with the several other appliances included in the
all-comprehensive word <span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span>, we can secure. To the
extent to which it is in our power to do this, it is in our power to
prevent epidemics.</p>

<p>The human family have now lived in communities more than
six thousand years, yet they have not learnt to make their habitations
clean. At last we are beginning to learn the lesson. When
we shall have mastered it, we shall have conquered epidemics.</p></div>

<p>Among the upper and middle classes distrust in vaccination
was general. How, indeed, could it be otherwise?
All were vaccinated, yet whenever smallpox was epidemic,
recipients of the rite enjoyed no immunity. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
one of Miss Mitford’s letters we find an experience and a
judgment which were far from uncommon. Writing, 1st
February, 1850, she observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About two months ago, my man, a very steady and respectable
servant, was seized with Smallpox after Vaccination. He was
very, very ill, delirious nearly a fortnight, and not a nurse could be
had for love or money. I have lost all faith in Vaccination, either
as preventing or mitigating Smallpox. I know of thirty severe
cases this winter, five of them fatal, in my own immediate neighbourhood,
and in Reading it has been a pestilence.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p></div>

<p>Vaccination among the poor was (as it is) detested.
Coaxed or forced into its reception without consideration
or preparation, like sheep or cattle, they realised its
mischiefs and misery in full measure; and naturally,
whenever pressure was relaxed, avoided its acquaintance.</p>

<p>How then did vaccination come to be imposed upon a
community thus affected? The answer is the usual one,
illustrated continually in English politics: an organised
interest, possessed with a definite intention, can always
prevail over the public&mdash;careless, uninstructed, and without
positive conviction. Under such circumstances, it is
a mere question of management what may be achieved in
Parliament at variance with the common welfare. Those
there get, who know how to take.</p>

<p>All trades and professions fulfil the law of their being
in striving after advantage and extension. The clergy
and the clerically-minded laity are persuaded that to
multiply churches and provide stipends, is to prepare for
the millennium, and nothing save hopelessness prevents
demands upon the national exchequer for the purpose.
The sacrifices the army and navy would exact on their
own behalf for security from foreign aggression are only
limited by the public incredulity. The commercial classes
are free-traders in principle; but if a protective bounty
could be had for any manufacture, it would be instantly
grasped at by those concerned, and most ingenious reasons
invented to justify that particular departure from the
rule of justice. This tendency of interests to aggrandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
themselves, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fas et nefas</i>, at the public expense, is
recognised by all statesmen, and is only kept in check by
perpetual vigilance.</p>

<p>What is true of all, is true of the medical profession,
crowded with competitors eager for employment. Vaccination
as a branch of business, capable of development
and endowment at the public cost, was certain of vigorous
promotion whenever there was opportunity; but not
until 1853 did the way open for the compulsory infliction
of the Jennerian rite. The undertaking was hazardous.
The opposition to which Canning and Peel had given
expression, had to be circumspectly encountered. It was
a job that might easily be wrecked; and therefore it was
considered inexpedient that the medical corporations
should appear too openly in the transaction. Instead, a
committee was formed in 1850 under the title of “The
Epidemiological Society for the Investigation of Epidemic
Diseases,” with a number of suitable decoys, and ostensible
occupation; but chiefly designed as an instrument
wherewith to operate on Parliament for the better establishment
and more liberal endowment of vaccination.</p>

<p>It was resolved to proceed tentatively&mdash;to secure if
possible the affirmation of compulsion, allowing the shock
of innovation to subside before going on to provide the
effective means of espionage and persecution. As it
turned out, the caution exercised was superfluous. Much
more might have been demanded and conceded of the
ignorance and indifference of the legislature. Lord
Lyttelton was selected to introduce what was called the
Vaccination Extension Bill, and in moving the second
reading in the House of Lords on 12th April, he ingenuously
disowned any qualification for the task, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have no scientific knowledge of the subject myself, and for my
information I am indebted to some able and learned persons
belonging to the Epidemiological Society&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Adding in proof of the manner in which he had been
crammed by the said “able and learned persons”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is unnecessary for me to speak of the certainty of Vaccination
as a preventive of Smallpox, that being a point on which <em>the whole
medical profession have arrived at complete unanimity</em>!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>The statistics with which Lord Lyttelton supported
the necessity for compulsion are interesting as indicating
the extent and irregularity of vaccination among the
English people. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are told that the number of births registered in England and
Wales in the year ending 29th September, 1852, was 601,839, and
the number vaccinated under the Act of 1840 was 397,128; so
that, in round numbers, 400,000 were vaccinated by the machinery
in force, leaving only 200,000, or one-third of the whole number,
to be treated by private vaccination. There are several fallacies in
that statement. The general result is by no means the consequence
of anything like a uniform system throughout the country.
I have before me a detailed statement of the extent of Vaccination
in various parts of England in 1851, which shows there is great
want of uniformity in certain districts. In towns where people
have a shorter distance to go to get their children vaccinated, the
result is more favourable than in the rural districts. For example,
in Birmingham, on the total number of births in 1851, the vaccinations
were 91 per cent.; in Leicester they were only 41 per cent.;
and in Loughborough only 18 per cent. The contrast between the
manufacturing and the rural districts is favourable on the side of
the former. In Bideford, the vaccinations were only 11 per cent.
upon the births; in West Ashford in Kent, they were only 22 per
cent.; and in Winchcomb only 6 per cent. While the general
average is lower in the agricultural than in the manufacturing
districts, some contrary instances are found. Thus in Derby the
vaccinations are only 42 per cent.; while at Watford, which is a
rural district, the vaccinations were 126 per cent. upon the births in
1851&mdash;which included, of course, the vaccination of children born
in previous years. But in London, and in no less a parish than
that of St. James, Westminster, it is reported that in 1851 on 973
births only 44 vaccinations took place; while in Wellingborough
Union, where there were 800 births in 1851, no vaccination at all
is reported!</p></div>

<p>Strange to say, Lord Lyttelton made no attempt to
complete his argument. He ought to have shown that
in the places where vaccination was least practised there
was most smallpox, and where most practised there was
least smallpox. Had he made the attempt, his eyes
might have been opened to the untrustworthy character
of “the able and learned person” by whom he had been
mendaciously primed.</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury, in supporting the measure, adduced
similar instances of neglected vaccination as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>He, too, forgot to show that these places were “decimated”
(that’s the word) with smallpox, whilst other
places where vaccination was generally practised enjoyed
exemption. On the contrary, with curious inconsequence,
he went on to recommend a sure prescription of his own,
namely, improved dwellings for the poor. These were
his words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is perfectly true that Smallpox is chiefly confined to the lowest
classes of the population; and I believe that <em>with improved lodging-houses,
the disease might be all but exterminated</em>.</p></div>

<p>Not a doubt of it; but if improved lodging-houses
would “all but exterminate smallpox,” why resort to
such a superfluity as vaccination?</p>

<p>There was no adverse discussion&mdash;indeed, no discussion
whatever. Lord Ellenborough observed of the Epidemiological
Society, under whose direction they were
legislating, that he “would not adventure upon the
extraordinary name by which the members are designated.”
The bill was read for the third time, <em>nem. diss.</em>,
on 18th April, and was introduced to the House of Commons
on 5th May, where its course was as uninterrupted
as in the Lords. Sir John Pakington, in moving the
second reading on 20th July, pleaded like Lord Lyttelton
his own ignorance, and the evidence and authority of the
Society with “the extraordinary name,” thus stating the
case&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An Act was passed in 1840, by which Boards of Guardians were
authorised to defray the expenses of Vaccination in their respective
unions. The Poor Law Board have done all in their power to carry
out the provisions of the Act; but still the grave fact remains, that
the system is voluntary: that in many places the people are prejudiced;
that a large proportion of the population is not vaccinated;
and that mortality from Smallpox exists to a very great extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
In the year ending March, 1843 out of 527,325 born in England
and Wales, only 183,000 or 34 per cent. were vaccinated. In the
succeeding years the vaccinated stood to the unvaccinated in the
following ratio:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">1844-45, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 to 156 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1845-46, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 to 134</p>

<p>In 1846-47 the births were 552,000 of which only 267,000 were
vaccinated, or about 50 per cent. of the whole. In consequence,
however, of stimulus applied by the Poor Law Board, two-thirds
of the births in 1847-48 were accounted for as vaccinated; but still
in many parts there prevails excessive neglect. For example, so
late as 1851 in 32 unions in and around Birmingham, the births
were 17,700 while the vaccinations were only 6,174&mdash;two-thirds
being unvaccinated.</p></div>

<p>Here, too, we note the omission of proof, that where
vaccination was neglected smallpox was prevalent, and
where practised smallpox was absent. Lord Palmerston
supported the second reading without hesitation. Sir
George Strickland was the only dissentient, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir John Pakington has himself supplied the strongest reason
why the bill should not pass. He has shown that Vaccination as
at present conducted is working well; but because some mothers
object to the practice, we are to be saddled with a compulsory law.
We are too prone to resort to force to overcome resistance, which
would yield to reason with the exercise of patience. What need
is there that we should imitate the legislation of Saxony, or Austria,
or Prussia in such a matter? In this country we cannot have one
law for the poor and another for the rich, and yet here we are asked
to apply a measure to the former which we could not think of for
the latter. How can we expect to abate prejudice against Vaccination
by compulsion? If we acted more on the old English principle
of leaving people to secure their welfare by their own good sense,
we should in the end achieve our purpose much more successfully.</p></div>

<p>The bill was read, for the third time in the House of
Commons without debate on the 13th, and received the
royal assent on 20th August, 1853. In short, it passed
through Parliament without opposition. What, it will
be asked, were its provisions?</p>

<p>By the Act (16 and 17 Vict. cap. 100) it was required&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That every child, whose health permits, shall be vaccinated
within three, or in case of orphanage within four months of birth,
by the public vaccinator of the district, or by some other <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'medica practitioner'">medical
practitioner</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That notice of this requirement, and information as to the
local arrangements for public vaccination, shall, whenever a birth
is registered, be given by the registrar of births to the parents or
guardians of the child.</p>

<p>3. That every medical practitioner who, whether in public or
private practice, successfully vaccinates a child shall send to the
local registrar of births a certificate that he has done so; and the
registrar shall keep a minute of all the notices given, and an account
of all the certificates thus received.</p>

<p>4. That parents or guardians who, without sufficient reason, after
having duly received the registrar’s notice of the requirement of
Vaccination, either omit to have a child duly vaccinated, or, this
being done, omit to have it inspected as to the results of Vaccination,
shall be liable to a penalty of £1; and all penalties shall be recoverable
under Jervis’s Act, and shall be paid toward the local
poor-rate.</p></div>

<p>Thus from 1853 every English parent became liable
to a fine of twenty shillings and costs who refused or
neglected to have his child vaccinated within three
months of birth. It may seem surprising that an Act so
arbitrary, enforcing an indefinite medical prescription
(for Vaccination was <em>not</em> defined, and Vaccination <em>is</em> a
rite of several varieties) should have been passed so
lightly; but we have to recollect the circumstances.
The House of Commons in those days was the house of
the upper and middle classes, and was as little affected
as the House of Lords itself by the proposed legislation.
It was an Act for application to the vulgar&mdash;to the prejudiced,
whose prejudices were to be encountered, not
with arguments, but with fines; an illustration of the
levity with which the unconcerned can dispose of the
opinions and feelings of those to whom they owe no
allegiance. Since that time the working-classes have
plainly discovered that they only obtain consideration
in Parliament in so far as they can make their power
felt in the constitution of Parliament. No rights are
secure that cannot be enforced, nor any justice certain
that cannot be vindicated. Those who hold their
ground by any other tenure than their own intelligence
and vigour are liable to continual imposition and
depredation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The good old rule, the simple plan,</p>
<p class="verse2">That they should take who have the power,</p>
<p class="verse0">And they should keep who can&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">is the abiding social law, however veiled or elevated in
application.</p>

<p>Again we have to recollect, that in 1853 there was no
developed or scientific resistance to vaccination. As to the
nature and value of the practice there was wide diversity
of opinion, notwithstanding Lord Lyttelton’s affirmation
of the complete unanimity of the medical profession; but
although such scepticism was general, the rite constituted
an established poll-tax among the respectable classes,
which sort of thing is never readily surrendered. Hence
it seemed less unreasonable to enforce the like observance
on “the ignorant and prejudiced” at the cost of the
poor-rate. When Canning refused to consent to compulsion
in 1808, cowpox had a competitor in smallpox
inoculation; and Peel in his later protest expressed the
preference of an expiring generation for living English
liberty over cut-and-dry subservience. Despotic philanthropy
was coming into vogue, and it was no longer
thought impracticable or inexpedient to do good to
people in spite of themselves. There was therefore
little to be said against the Act of 1853 beyond what
Sir George Strickland expressed. The right of the prejudiced
and ignorant to the enjoyment of their prejudice
and ignorance had become obsolete and indefensible.</p>

<p>The report of the Epidemiological Society was taken
as the warrant for the Act of 1853 alike by the Lords
and Commons. Turning to that report,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> it is difficult in
a few words to convey an adequate idea of its untruthful
character. Whoever, it is said, wills the end wills the
means; and certain medical men having resolved to
make vaccination compulsory whatever was requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
had to be accomplished; and Dr. Seaton undertook the
operation, the Epidemiological Society, of which he was
“the ruling spirit”,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> playing the part of guarantee. For
the persuasion of the Lords and Commons, an advocacy
of vaccination without hesitation or qualification was
deemed advisable, and the line was thus followed up&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox is a disease to which every person is liable who is not
protected by a previous attack or by Vaccination. In its unmodified
form it is fatal to about one in four or one in five of all whom
it invades; and, when it does not destroy life, it in many cases disfigures
and deteriorates the general health. Every case of it is a
centre of contagion, and every unvaccinated or imperfectly vaccinated
population is a nidus for the disease to settle in and propagate
itself. It is on the two latter propositions, which do not admit
of being controverted, that we conceive any enactment for rendering
Vaccination compulsory must be based. If it admit of doubt
how far it is justifiable in this free country to compel a person to
take care of his own life and that of his offspring, it can scarcely
be disputed that no one has a right to put in jeopardy the lives of
his fellow-subjects.</p></div>

<p>All will recognise the authoritative air of the foregoing,
so impressive where nothing better is known;
but the indisputable proposition, “that no one has a
right to put in jeopardy the lives of his fellow-subjects,”
was curiously inconsistent with faith in the asserted
prophylactic; for if the vaccinated were secure from
smallpox, how could the unvaccinated place their lives
in jeopardy? The style assumed was thus maintained&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are ourselves satisfied, and it is the concurrent and unanimous
testimony of nearly 2,000 medical men with whom we have
been in correspondence, that Vaccination is a perfectly safe and
efficient prophylactic against this disease.</p>

<p>This proposition we hold to be proved&mdash;</p>

<p>1. By the general immunity with which it is found that those
who have been vaccinated can mingle with Smallpox patients, a
fact so familiar that we do not feel that we need adduce any illustration
of it.</p>

<p>2. By the gradual decrease which has taken place in the mortality
from Smallpox, as compared with the mortality from all causes,
since Vaccination has been introduced and been generally received.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the immunity of the vaccinated, it was disproved
in every smallpox epidemic, and in every smallpox
hospital, and by the precautions and terrors of
those accounted secure. To sustain the proposition that
smallpox had decreased in consequence of the introduction
of vaccination, a variety of statistical tables were
adduced, English and Continental; but had the Lords or
Commons subjected them to scrutiny they would have
discovered that the details were either irrelevant or
adverse to the conclusion asserted. Many of the statistics,
especially of last century, were not certainties, but
conjectures and estimates, vitiated, too, with the bias of
their compilers. When it is said that smallpox decreased
in consequence of the introduction of vaccination, the
answer is that smallpox was decreasing prior to its
introduction in almost every country of Europe; and
that the decrease continued irrespective of its influence,
save in so far as it might have discouraged the culture
of smallpox by inoculation. To illustrate this contention
it may suffice to take the table of London Smallpox set
forth by Dr. Seaton, in which the average of deaths from
Smallpox in every 1000 deaths from all causes was
contrasted in decennial periods for fifty years, prior and
subsequent to the introduction of vaccination.</p>

<p class="noindent">The figures are far from trustworthy, but taking them
as they stand, and admitting the decline, where was the
proof that it was due to vaccination? The introduction
of that practice was one thing: its application quite
another. There was no reason to believe that more
Londoners were vaccinated in 1820 than in 1810, or in
1840 than in 1830; indeed, the available evidence went
to the contrary, vaccination having fallen in repute after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the furore of 1801-5, and the demonstration of its impotence
and its injuriousness. Probably not ten per
cent. of the births in London up to 1840 were accounted
for as vaccinated; and notwithstanding the provision of
vaccination at the cost of the poor-rate by the Act of
1840, not fifty per cent. in 1850. Yet to a cause so
utterly inadequate, the steady decline in London Smallpox
was ascribed! The same fallacy pervaded the
statistics of other countries and cities, yet so strong was
the prepossession in favour of the conclusion determined
upon, that it was apparently neither seen nor suspected,
obvious though it was.</p>

<p>Nor was it surprising that with a disposition so fixed
and obtuse, no enlarged or philosophic views should have
been entertained. “Smallpox,” said Dr. Seaton, “had
decreased compared with mortality from other causes.”
True; but what if mortality from other causes had compensated
for the decrease of smallpox? and if such compensation
had taken place, as, for example, in Glasgow,
in what consisted the advantage? Again, no reference
was made to illness and death resulting from vaccination,
as if the rite were harmless as baptism. Allowing that
the practice did in some occult fashion tend to the
abatement of smallpox, it was still open to question
whether the infliction of an acute specific disease on all
sorts and conditions of infancy was not likely to be far
more injurious to life than the smallpox it was supposed
to avert. Such considerations, however, were foreign to
Dr. Seaton and his Epidemiological Society with whom
vaccination stood for little else than an extension of
medical business at the public cost.</p>

<p>It is not to be forgotten that the Act of 1853 brought
to fruition what was long hankered after by the trade
spirit of the medical profession. The Act of 1840 endowed
vaccination out of the poor-rate; but to make
the rite compulsory and to ensure good pay for its performance
was the consummation desired. The terms
and conditions that ensued on the Act of 1840 are thus
described by Dr. Seaton&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fee paid in England and Wales varies from 1s. to 2s. 6d.,
never falling below or rising above those sums. In 1842 and 1843,
the Commissioners estimated the average fee at 1s. 9d. From our
inquiries, it appears that in the large manufacturing towns the fee
varies from 1s. to 1s. 6d.; the larger sums of 2s. and 2s. 6d. being
paid for the most part in country towns. In London, the more
ordinary fee is 1s. 6d.; in several parishes 2s. 6d. is paid; and in
one, 1s. In some few unions a bad principle obtains of paying a
larger sum for a certain number of cases, as 50, and a smaller sum
for all above. The average payment per case for the whole of
England and Wales from 1841 to 1851 inclusive, was 1s. 5½d.</p>

<p>In Ireland, the payment appears to be very low. The more
general sum is 1s., often 6d.; in three or four instances, 3d. and
4d. The vicious principle just noticed, of paying a higher fee for a
limited number of cases, seems to be almost universal. Thus,
where 1s. is the fee, this is paid for the first 200 cases, and 6d. for
all above. In one case, Nenagh, 1s. is paid up to 200, and 1d. for
all above. In other cases, 3d. and 4d. are paid for all above a
certain number. Whilst this pitiful remuneration exists, it is not
surprising to find that in many districts the medical practitioners
decline the appointment, leaving the people unvaccinated.</p>

<p>According to the information we have received, it is found, as
might be anticipated, that on the whole Vaccination is more
efficiently carried out in the districts where the higher fee of 2s. 6d.
is paid; or where, as in large towns, the number and proximity of
children compensate the vaccinator in some degree for lower
payment.</p></div>

<p>The better pay, the better vaccination! The object
of the Epidemiological Society, as the stalking-horse
of the medical trades-unions, lay in those fees. Vaccination
was a pretext for a universal poll-tax, set at
as high a figure as practicable, to be succeeded when
possible by compulsory revaccination, with a correspondent
tariff annexed. Recalling the early days of vaccination
when the operation was described as simplicity
itself, and when women, parsons, and busybodies inoculated
and propagated “the benign fluid” under
Jenner’s authority, it was remarkable to have the rite
thus formalised and converted into the peculium of a
priesthood. Nor can it be objected that when vaccination
was thus practised, it was ineffective against smallpox;
for whenever its virtue is brought into dispute, we
are referred to those primitive times and that primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
practice for the most successful and unquestionable
exhibitions of its power.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caveat emptor</i> is a well-recognised caution, which to
avoid was the purpose of the Epidemiological Society.
A mercantile transaction was carried out under the
cloak of impartial science. No reader of Seaton’s report
could suppose otherwise than that vaccination was
universally regarded as an infallible preventive of smallpox,
and that if by any means the English people could
be subjected to its observance, they would obtain immunity
from the disease. Evidence to the contrary was
kept out of sight; and yet evidence to the contrary lay
within the knowledge of every medical man; and proof
might be adduced to weariness from contemporary medical
literature to show that in this respect the Epidemiological
report was contrived to blind and mislead
Parliament. As a witness, none will impugn Sir Henry
Holland, and writing in 1839 he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not only in Great Britain, but throughout every part of the
globe, we find that Smallpox has been gradually increasing in
frequency as an epidemic; affecting a larger proportion of the
vaccinated; and inflicting greater mortality in its results.</p>

<p>The early enthusiasm for the great discovery of Jenner swept
doubts away; and they returned only tardily, and under the compulsion
of facts.... Any explanation from the ignorant or imperfect
performance of Vaccination was found insufficient to meet the
number and variety of the proofs. And, though more palpable at
one time than another, according to the greater or less prevalence
of epidemic causes, yet every succeeding year has multiplied them,
and every statement from other countries attested their truth.</p>

<p>It is no longer expedient, in any sense, to argue for the present
practice of Vaccination as a certain or permanent preventive of
Smallpox. The truth must be told, as it is, that the earlier anticipations
on this point have not been realised.... Whether
Smallpox may ever be wholly eradicated is a very doubtful question,
and the probability is on the negative side.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p></div>

<p>In statements like these, Dr. Holland did no more than
express the contemporary conviction of the medical profession.
Vaccination was not surrendered: whilst it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
allowed that it could not be trusted to prevent smallpox,
it was held that it made the disease milder, and that
whilst its prophylaxy wore out, it was renewable by
revaccination. Obvious it was that vaccination thus
qualified could never obtain legislative sanction; but
such sanction being imperatively demanded, the Epidemiological
Society provided what was thought requisite for
Parliamentary conviction.</p>

<p>It is said that Vaccination was a medical question;
but all questions are transformed when they ascend to
politics. The origin, character, and action of varieties of
animal virus are mysteries, and may remain mysteries
with general indifference; but when it is claimed that
the inoculation of such virus prevents smallpox, and that
whoever refuses to submit his child to the said inoculation
shall be fined 20s., then the matter is brought within
the personal jurisdiction of every citizen, and he becomes
entitled to information, to the exercise of his judgment,
and the expression of his opinion. As a mystery, vaccination
belongs to experts; but as a Parliamentary preventive
of smallpox it is within the discrimination of all
who can observe and appreciate the evidence of numbers.
For a legislator like Lord Lyttelton to confess his ignorance,
and that he moved under the dictation of certain
“able and learned persons,” was to abandon his proper
function, and surrender himself to imposture.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under the terror of the 20s. fine, proclaimed everywhere
by vaccinators voracious for fees, a prodigious extension
of practice was effected in 1854. The vaccinations under
one year of age were more than doubled; and nearly
300,000 children above one year old, to whom the law
did not apply, were driven into the net, and “cut for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
pox” at the public expense. Thus the public vaccinations
of 1854 exceeded the births of that year by 75,000.
Subsequently the rate fell off and fluctuated as appears
from the following table for England and Wales&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet this extension of practice did not satisfy the
medical adventurers of the Epidemiological Society.
They pointed out that universal vaccination was the
desideratum, and these results fell short of universality&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Act of 1853 was intended to apply not to 65 per cent. of the
births, but to every child born. A certain deduction, it is true,
must be made for those privately vaccinated; and whilst there are
no data for exactly estimating the proportion of these (which
probably varies considerably in different parts of the Kingdom);
yet taking the country throughout, there is reason to believe that
not more than from 10 to 15 per cent. of the children born are so
vaccinated; for it is found that in unions where particular care is
bestowed upon public vaccination, the number publicly operated
on is from 85 to 90 per cent. of the births. If we estimate 80 per
cent. only, as the number requiring to be provided for by public
vaccination, the results of last year [1854] fall short of those which
should be attained by nearly 100,000.</p></div>

<p>This estimate is worth attention as sustaining a conclusion
I have repeatedly tried to enforce. Prior to 1840,
vaccination was a matter almost exclusively of private
concern, extending to no more than 10 or 15 per cent. of
the population&mdash;or, let us allow, 20 per cent.&mdash;and those
chiefly the well fed, well clad, and well housed. Yet the
diminution of smallpox, dating from a period in last century
when variolous inoculation was in full practice and
cowpox was unknown, is persistently ascribed to the
introduction of vaccination which up to 1840 did not
apply to more than one-fifth of the people; the four-fifths
exempt from the prophylaxy being notoriously the
chief factors of the disease!</p>

<p>Parliament having so readily consented to the Compulsory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
Act of 1853, it gave cause for acute chagrin that
more had not been asked, when more might so easily
have been had; and the operators behind the Epidemiological
Society set to work to try whether the lost
opportunity might not be retrieved. In a Memorial
addressed to the President of the Board of Health in the
name of the Society, in 1855,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> we find a project developed
which lacked nothing of audacity and comprehensiveness.
First, the virtue of vaccination was asserted in unqualified
terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox is the most preventive of diseases, differing from all
other epidemic diseases in this remarkable respect, that while these
latter can only be prevented by discovering and remedying the
various conditions (as of crowding, want of drainage, filth, and the
like) which give rise to or assist in the dissemination of the specific
poison of each disease, the former may be guarded against and
prevented by a direct prophylactic measure. To Smallpox, in
short, there is an antidote. The same cannot be affirmed, in the
present state of knowledge, of any other epidemic disease.</p>

<p>That antidote is Vaccination. In exact proportion as this has
been efficiently practised, have the extent and severity of Smallpox
been diminished over the surface of the world. To the neglect of
it, or to its inefficient performance, is due the large existing
mortality from the disease in this country.</p></div>

<p>Evidently the advice, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pecca fortiter</i>, had been laid to
heart by the framer of the preceding declaration. Certainly
the scheme for which it stood as preamble required
violent justification. It was no less than the institution
of a Vaccination Office with despotic powers as a department
of State. The appointment of public vaccinators
subordinate to the Board of Guardians, subject to contract,
and paid out of the poor-rate, was held to be a
degrading form of service: it prejudiced vaccination as
a form of alms, and reduced medical men to the rank of
parochial officers. Worst of all, the pay was bad&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The provisions for the remuneration of public vaccinators have
not been such as to secure their hearty and zealous co-operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
The most injurious consequences have undoubtedly resulted from
this, both in limiting the numbers vaccinated, and in discouraging
the vaccinators from giving that pains and attention to watch the
progress of the Vaccine Disease which are imperatively necessary.</p></div>

<p>They must, therefore, be emancipated. An independent
organisation, with a medical chief, was essential alike
to the mystery and dignity of the craft, and the universal
and efficient exercise of its functions. To save the
country from smallpox, two conditions were requisite&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First, that it be made a matter of legal obligation on all persons
resident within England and Wales, whether born within that
portion of the Kingdom or not, to give evidence of being vaccinated.</p>

<p>Second, that to achieve this end, there be provided administrative
science, zeal, and activity.</p>

<p>The union of these conditions is indispensable; either without
the other will fail.</p></div>

<p>It was pointed out that the Act of 1853 only applied
to children born in England and Wales after a certain
date&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It does not extend to the whole existing population, nor to immigrants.
It is well known that Smallpox is largely imported into
this country, and kept up from Ireland. These Irish not only form
a nidus for the disease in towns where they collect in large numbers,
but they disseminate it throughout the country at harvest
time, and in the season of hopping.</p></div>

<p>To fight and overcome smallpox, to meet and arrest
epidemics, the law must be administered by qualified,
zealous, and “adequately remunerated” officers; but
“the keystone to any effective system” must be a
commander-in-chief&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No compulsory enactment, however comprehensive and stringent;
no alteration in the mode of appointing public vaccinators, however
desirable; no additional remuneration and encouragement
to them, however necessary, will be sufficient to secure the grand
object to be had in view, the Universal diffusion of Vaccination and
the Extinction of Smallpox, unless there be some competent and
energetic Medical Officer to harmonise the whole system and keep
it in constant activity; to examine continually its working, that
what is defective may be immediately supplied; and, in cases in
which it is required, to enforce the law, whether against those who
refuse to submit themselves to Vaccination, or against those who,
by travelling about, diffuse Smallpox throughout the Kingdom.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>It was further said, “The changes thus proposed <em>have
long been looked forward to</em> by the president and council
of the Epidemiological Society as essential to a proper
system of public vaccination”&mdash;of which, indeed, there
was no doubt; for to effect the said changes was the
chief end of the Society and of its ruling spirit, Dr.
Edward C. Seaton. Though it may seem incredible, it
will not surprise any who have studied the habit of the
thorough-bred quack, that the designated commander-in-chief,
“the keystone of the system,” the miraculous
combination of scientific and administrative ability, was
none other than the projector, Dr. Seaton himself! He
it was who in fancy saw himself the elected head of the
New Vaccination Office, with place and pay at his disposal,
and power to examine and vaccinate every resident
upon English soil.</p>

<p>The Memorial concluded with the opinion that in view
of “the continued high rate of mortality from smallpox,”
some measure should be concerted “for carrying out the
alterations suggested during the present (1855) session of
Parliament.”</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the project developed in
the Memorial was an impracticability; and that it should
have been “long looked forward to by the president and
council of the Epidemiological Society” proves what
manner of dreamers they were. The mortality from
smallpox in England and Wales constituted, they said,
2 per cent. of the national mortality; but not even the
reduction of the 2 per cent. could have reconciled the
people to the New Vaccination Office with its ruling
spirit, its expenditure, and its inquisitors. Bad as smallpox
may be, there is worse than smallpox; and much
worse would have been Dr. Seaton with his pernicious
quackery and his intrusive myrmidons. The recrudescence
of similar projects from time to time attests the
existence of visionaries who not only misunderstand the
temper and traditions of their countrymen, but the constitution
of human nature itself.</p>

<p>The year 1855 was one of war and excitement, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
bill drawn on the lines of the Memorial was introduced
to the House of Commons providing that from the 1st of
January, 1856, the vaccination of the people should be
committed to a medical superintendent with a medical
staff, drawing their salaries from the Treasury, who
would take over the existing local administration from
the Poor Law authorities, and organise and develop it
afresh. Further, it was provided&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That every adult person resident in England and Wales on 1st
January, 1856, who had not already been successfully vaccinated,
nor had Smallpox, be vaccinated by a duly qualified practitioner,
or by a public vaccinator, within three months of that date, and
submit to an inspection by the medical man, or public vaccinator,
eight days after vaccination, under a penalty of £1.</p>

<p>That adults not born in England and Wales, and coming to reside
therein, be vaccinated (if not already vaccinated) within three
months of their arrival, under a penalty of £1.</p>

<p>That children be taken by their parents to be vaccinated within
three months after 1st January, 1856, and be inspected eight days
after vaccination, under a penalty of £1.</p>

<p>That children brought to England and Wales from other parts
be vaccinated in like manner within three months of their arrival.</p>

<p>That children and adults be revaccinated until the operation is
declared successful. If after repeated vaccinations, a patient prove
insusceptible, a certificate to that effect shall protect him from the
penalty otherwise rigidly inflicted.</p>

<p>That Public Vaccinators be entitled to a fee of 2s. 6d. for every
child or adult successfully vaccinated within two miles of the Vaccinator’s
residence, and 3s. 6d. if beyond that limit. That Medical
Practitioners, not public vaccinators, be entitled to 1s. for every
person entered by them on the register as vaccinated.</p>

<p>That a certificate of successful vaccination be granted for the
trifling fee of 6d.</p>

<p>That the Superintendent be empowered to institute rigid inquiry
and to prosecute for penalties wherever he suspects the regulations
of the Act have been neglected or violated.</p></div>

<p>Here, indeed, was a dose of despotism for Englishmen!
Nothing being done in 1855, there was time for reconsideration.
It was felt that the withdrawal of vaccination
from local administration was too revolutionary;
and another bill was introduced in 1856, under the
direction of Mr. W. F. Cowper, President of the Board of
Health (dropping the New Vaccination Office), with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
provisions for the inspection and vaccination of children
in public schools, and of emigrants; for revaccination in
the event of epidemics; and for coroners’ inquests on
unvaccinated children dying of smallpox. There was no
popular demand for such legislation. It was promoted
by a group of medical place-hunters operating under the
mask of the Epidemiological Society. The solitary
petition in its favour was presented, 26th May, 1856, by
Mr. James Furness Marson, a comrade of Dr. Seaton in
the direction of the Society. Marson was resident surgeon
of the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate, and as
evidence of his unscrupulous advocacy, we may take the
following assertions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Petitioner has, in the course of twenty years, vaccinated
upwards of 40,000 persons, and has never seen any evil results
traceable to Vaccination, with the exception of a single instance in
which measles occurred at the same time, and four or five examples
of rather severely sore arms arising from lymph recently taken
from the cow. He has never seen other diseases communicated
from the Vaccine Disease, nor does he believe in the popular
reports that they are ever so communicated.</p>

<p>The mortality from Smallpox in the Unvaccinated, of cases taken
generally, is 35 per cent.; and among the Vaccinated attacked by
Smallpox it is 7 per cent.</p>

<p>Among children under fourteen years of age who have been
vaccinated, Smallpox hardly ever proves fatal.</p>

<p>As an example of what can be done by efficient Vaccination,
your Petitioner begs to state that not one of the servants or nurses
of the Smallpox Hospital has had Smallpox for the last twenty
years. They have all been either vaccinated or revaccinated on
coming to live at the Hospital.</p></div>

<p>The Petitioner omitted to mention how many of the
said servants and nurses had entered the Hospital as
patients, and were pleased to remain as officials. Prevarication
throughout was the note of Marson’s petition:
he might argue that what he stated was true&mdash;true under
conditions and reserves unstated.</p>

<p>It is often observed that the crafty never operate so
successfully as when they have the earnest and ingenuous
for instruments; and in Mr. Cowper, President of the
Board of Health, the wire-pullers of the Epidemiological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Society had just such a tool. He believed what he was
told, and delivered it with his own sincerity. In moving
the second reading of the Bill on 31st March, he represented
its object as “nothing more than the consolidation
and amendment of preceding Acts;” and went on to
say&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is admitted by every medical man whose opinion is worth a
moment’s consideration, that Vaccination is a specific against
Smallpox; of course I mean where the operation is properly performed.
In fact, it is a point decided in the medical world that
Vaccination, when properly performed, is a guarantee against
Smallpox, except in extremely rare cases; and no evidence has
been produced to justify the idea that it is attended with injurious
consequences. Statistics show that in proportion as Vaccination
is extended, the mortality from Smallpox is diminished.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">And so on; the lesson being recited with all the docility
of a good child. Mr. Henley struck a different note&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is considerable dissatisfaction throughout the country with
the mode in which Vaccination is performed. In my own neighbourhood,
for example, the poor people complain that all sorts of
eruptions appear on their children after the Vaccination they are
compelled to undergo; and though they may be quite wrong, you
cannot persuade them to the contrary. Then, too, I cannot approve
of the transfer of Vaccination from the Guardians to a Central
Medical Board. That change must be removed from the bill.</p></div>

<p>The second reading having passed unopposed on 31st
March, and nothing more being heard of the bill, Mr. T.
Duncombe, who knew the ropes of the parliamentary
ship, grew suspicious, and on 7th July asked Mr. Cowper
if he could fix a time when the bill would be brought on.
Suspicion was amply justified by Mr. Cowper’s answer.
He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bill is not one in which Members take any great interest.
It is one of that class of bills which are usually taken at a late
period of the evening; and I hope the Hon. Member will not
object to its being taken at the same time as other bills of similar
character.</p></div>

<p>To which Mr. Duncombe replied&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>If Hon. Members do not care for the bill, they do great injustice
to the people, because it is a compulsory bill. Two hundred
petitions have been presented against it, and only one in its favour.
A more arrant job than this bill I never knew, and I hope an
opportunity may be given me to oppose it.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Cowper’s simplicity was apparent in his answer.
He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not mean that the bill is of no importance, for it is intended
to check the ravages of a disease which kills thousands every year.
What I intended was, that the opposition which my Hon. Friend
offers is not shared by other Members. My Hon. Friend says the
bill will make Vaccination compulsory; but Vaccination is compulsory
already. The purpose of the bill is to consolidate and improve
existing legislation. It would be much fairer if my Hon.
Friend brought in a bill to repeal compulsion. I will not bring in
the bill after 12 o’clock at night.</p></div>

<p>The pledge not to bring on the bill after midnight
settled its fate. Its promoters, aware that its provisions
would not hear discussion, had reckoned on its unopposed
passage at an hour when members were few, weary, and
indifferent. Mr. Duncombe’s vigilance defeated the
scheme, which Mr. Cowper incontinently revealed. The
bill was brought into Committee on 10th July, and the
order for its reading discharged amid general satisfaction.
Mr. Henley observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am very glad this bill is withdrawn. The endeavour to make
Vaccination compulsory has been most mischievous. Vaccination
was quietly making its way. People were adopting it more and
more; but from the moment it was made compulsory, they began
to think every evil which happened to their children afterwards
ensued from it. I have no objection to refer the question to a
Select Committee as suggested, but whatever their report, nothing
will satisfy me that it is advisable to make Vaccination compulsory.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Duncombe agreed that the course proposed was
judicious&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question is delicate and difficult, and investigation should
precede legislation. In 1853, at a later period of the session than
that at which we have arrived, the Compulsory Vaccination Act
was smuggled through the House. Fortunately it became inoperative
through its own defects, which it is now proposed to remove,
and to make the law more stringent; but while I believe that
great good has resulted from Vaccination, I do not think we should
try to encourage it by penal enactment.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cowper, in protesting against surrender, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some argue as if people should never be forced to do what they
do not like; but the force of this objection is greatly weakened
when we recollect that in compelling Vaccination we are not
obliging parents to do anything disadvantageous to themselves,
but merely to take precautions against a loathsome and terrible
disease.</p></div>

<p>The most intolerable tyrannies vindicate themselves
by the advantages they enforce on their perverse subjects.
The claim made for vaccination, that it protects
the vaccinated from smallpox, deprived the vaccinated
of any right to complain of risk of injury from the unvaccinated.
Moreover, that those who were persuaded
that vaccination neither prevented nor mitigated smallpox
should be required to undergo an operation, that was
to them a cruel and dangerous imposture, was surely a
wrong of the most excruciating character. It was well
that neither the bill of 1855 or 1856 was allowed to
pass; but if either had passed, it might have brought the
question of compulsion to an earlier issue.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">JOHN GIBBS’S LETTER&mdash;1855.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">As we have said, there was little living confidence in
vaccination. Jenner’s undertaking, “that the person
inoculated with cowpox is rendered perfectly secure from
the infection of smallpox,” had been everywhere conspicuously
belied. But latterly a new faith had come
into existence as to the preventibility of disease and the
possibility of its suppression; and, thus persuaded, the
public were less disposed to be sceptical toward new or
revived prophylactic impostures. Favoured by this disposition
of the public mind, a clique of vaccinators,
operating under cover of the Epidemiological Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
were able to obtain concessions from Parliament which,
prior to the sanitary evangel, were unattainable. It was
only when too audacious, they proposed to set up a
Vaccination Office, endowed from the Exchequer, with
inquisitorial and punitive functions, that they suffered
check.</p>

<p>To resist doctrine it is necessary to possess doctrine.
People might distrust or dislike vaccination, but they
were at a great disadvantage against aggressors until
prepared to justify their distrust and dislike in definite
and scientific form, setting evidence against assertion,
and veracious against factitious statistics. Unfortunately
the mischief of coercive legislation was consummated ere
opposition was organised. The first to frame a comprehensive
indictment against vaccination was John Gibbs,
an Irish gentleman. It took the form of a letter
addressed to Sir Benjamin Hall, dated from Maze Hill
Cottage, St. Leonards-on-Sea, 30th June, 1855. On the
motion of Joseph Brotherton, M.P. for Salford, the letter
was ordered to be printed by the House of Commons,
31st March, 1856.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gibbs opened his letter with drawing attention to
the fact that whilst the Compulsory Act of 1853 was
the first direct attack upon personal liberty in medical
matters, there was “no subject upon which so many
otherwise well-informed persons betrayed such ignorance
and credulity as upon vaccination.” Indeed, upon
nothing were the legislators who enacted compulsion so
frank as in their confession of ignorance and submission
to medical instruction. What was there to justify
legislation on terms thus abject against their fellow-countrymen?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why is Vaccination held in abhorrence by so many? Have
those who reject it no weighty reasons to justify their rejection?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
They do not believe that it affords an efficient and assured protection
against the invasion of Smallpox; they have a natural disgust
to the transfer of a loathsome virus from a diseased brute, through
they know not how many unhealthy human mediums, to the
veins of their children; they have a dread, a conviction, that other
filthy diseases, tending to embitter and shorten life, are frequently
transmitted through the vaccine virus; they cannot bring themselves
to believe that the true way to health can be to corrupt the
blood and lower the vital energies by the infusion of a poison and
its consequent train of morbid influences; and further, they have
a conscientious conviction that voluntarily to propagate disease is
to set at naught the Divine Providence and violate the Divine Will.</p>

<p>Are such scruples and objections entitled to no respect? Should
they be permitted to have no force? Are they capable of no
justification? Should the sole answer to them be a Coercion Act?
Such is not the best way to disarm hostility, and to ensure conviction.
Who would put faith in the professions of a philanthropist
who should threaten the objects of his beneficence with fine or
imprisonment if they did not accept his proffered boon? Or who
could receive with cordiality and respect the doctor of physic who
should thunder at the door, armed with scab and lancet, threatening
to assault the inmates if they did not accept his services? If
Vaccination be indeed a blessing which must needs be showered
upon the land, would it not be more becoming in a wise Government
and a free people to trust to the dissemination of information rather
than attempt to make unconverted converts by force?</p></div>

<p>Had smallpox been preventible by vaccination, such
contention would have been useless. The virtue of the
rite, manifest in its efficacy, would have secured its
observance. The bitterness of compulsion lay in the
attempt to enforce imposture, and to suppress the convictions
of those whose perceptions were sharper, and
whose loyalty to right was more determined than in the
mass of the nation. Mr. Gibbs had no difficulty in
adducing evidence in proof that vaccination did not
prevent smallpox. The reports of the Registrar-General
and the hospitals furnished testimony in such profusion,
that his difficulty lay in the selection of examples likely
to be most convincing. From the <cite>Lancet</cite>, of 21st May,
1853, he took the following confession&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the public mind extensively, and to a more limited extent in
the medical profession itself, doubts are known to exist as to the
efficacy and eligibility of Vaccination. The failures of the operation
have been numerous and discouraging.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did the failure to prevent smallpox exhaust the
condemnation of vaccination. Ineffective, it was far
from harmless. Itself a disease, it was a conductor and
excitant of other diseases, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and, inoculcated'">and, inoculated</ins>, occasionally
bore with it other company. Erysipelas, as Jenner taught,
was the note of successful vaccination; but erysipelas,
not being a limitable affection, was frequently a mortal
one; and deaths from erysipelas as a sequence of vaccination
were of constant occurrence. Then there were
skin eruptions, carbuncular and glandular swellings,
tuberculosis, scrofula, syphilis, etc., either provoked or
inseminated with the vaccine disease. Such results
were so distinctly recognised that, in the <cite>Lancet</cite>, of the
11th November, 1854, it was stated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So widely extended is the dread that along with the prophylaxy
something else may be inoculated, that few medical practitioners
would care to vaccinate their own children from a source of the
purity of which they are not well assured.</p></div>

<p>But the care vaccinators exercised over their own offspring
was impracticable for the multitude. Again, citing
the <cite>Lancet</cite>, 23rd October, 1854, it was said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The poor are told that they must carry their children to be
vaccinated by medical men who may be strangers to them. They
apprehend&mdash;and the apprehension is not altogether unfounded, or
unshared by the educated classes, that the vaccine matter employed
may carry with it the seeds of other diseases not less loathsome
than the one it is intended to prevent.</p></div>

<p>Useless against smallpox, and injurious in itself, it
remained to test the influence of vaccination on the
health of the community&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What is the per centage of deaths from all epidemics among the
Vaccinated as compared with the Unvaccinated? What is the
per centage respectively of cases of disease of the respiratory
organs, of skin diseases, of scrofula, and of convulsions? What
is the average duration of life among the Vaccinated and among
the Unvaccinated? Of a thousand children vaccinated within a
given time after birth, and of a thousand unvaccinated, the whole
two thousand being placed as nearly as possible in like circumstances,
what per centage in each thousand attain the age of
puberty?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>These are statistics with which the advocates of Vaccination have
never grappled. Is it not, then, rather premature to decide that
Vaccination is an unmixed good, a boon which we ought not only
gratefully to accept, but which we should even combine to force
upon the acceptance of others?</p>

<p>If it should appear that before a given age the rate of mortality
from all causes be the same among a thousand vaccinated and a
thousand unvaccinated children, of what avail is Vaccination?
Of what import is it, as a public question, in what shape death
claims his allotted number of victims, whether by Smallpox,
Scarlet Fever, or Hooping Cough? If, however, the rate of
mortality should prove to be greater among the Vaccinated than
among the Unvaccinated, how shall we avoid the conclusion that
Vaccination is a curse and not a blessing?</p></div>

<p>The interdependence of the forms of zymotic disease,
so luminously displayed by Dr. Watt in the statistics of
Glasgow, was apparently a conception in excess of the
capacity of the average medical mind. It was the custom
of vaccinators to treat smallpox as a solitary existence,
any diminution of which was ascribed to the
observance of their rite, and any increase to its neglect,
although the observance of the rite was neither less in
the waxing, nor more in the waning of the disease. With
many illustrations from medical literature, Mr. Gibbs enforced
the lesson that diseases were not irregular and
detached disasters, but varied manifestations of a common
disorder: that when one form prevailed, other forms
abated or disappeared; that health, and the defect of
health, were referable to habits and conditions of life;
and that the consequent rate of mortality was unaffected
whether smallpox happened to be one of its factors&mdash;indeed,
in numerous instances, a reduced rate of mortality
signalised the prevalence of smallpox. In short, to suppose
that the creation and culture of an ailment like vaccination
could by any means tend to the invigoration
of life was to reverse the canon&mdash;that health always and
everywhere was the best defence of health.</p>

<p>Among the supporters of his thesis, none had greater
weight than Dr. George Gregory. Adducing “the experience
which twenty years of official connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital had given him,”
he asserted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The great principle that there are no diseases strictly isolated
from others. They are links in a chain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry fs80">
<p class="verse0">“All are but parts of one stupendous whole.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">They must be viewed in conjunction, if we would hope to form just,
enlarged, and legitimate views of the character and pathological
affinities of each.</p></div>

<p>Long surmised, but never proved, until the statistical
inquiries of recent times showed its correctness, Dr. Gregory
continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We may, for want of a better name, call this curious doctrine the
Law of Vicarious Mortality; by which is understood that whenever
one epidemic diminishes, another increases, so that the sum total
of epidemic mortality remains, on an average of years, nearly the
same.</p>

<p>We learn from this table, that every year is distinguished by
some master epidemic. In 1838, Smallpox was the ruling epidemic
throughout England. In 1839, Measles and Scarlet Fever struggled
for the mastery. In 1840, Scarlet Fever was so general and so fatal,
that the mortality by it exceeded by one-fifth the ravages of Smallpox
during the epidemic season of 1838, and more than doubled the
mortality by that disease in 1839....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything teaches us that when one avenue to death is closed
another opens&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry fs80">
<p class="verse0">“Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Vaccination, great as its merits are [What are they?&mdash;J. G.], and
no one more fully appreciates them than I do, does not, and cannot
do, all that its too sanguine admirers promised. The blessings of
Vaccination are met and balanced by the Law of Vicarious Mortality.
How and why is this? The explanation is easy. The weak
plants of a nursery must be weeded out. If weakly children do not
fall victims to Smallpox, they live to fall into the jaws of tyrants
scarcely less inexorable. Scarlet Fever and Measles are both advancing
in respect of mortality; and the increase of deaths by
Hooping Cough since this century set in [that is, since the introduction
of Vaccination.&mdash;J. G.] is quite extraordinary.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p></div>

<p>The concession of so much was the concession of all.
If smallpox was merely displaced to be replaced, and the
tale of death maintained by cognate diseases, what was
there to claim for vaccination, even if it were allowed to
have an influence adverse to smallpox? Where were the
lives saved? and where the glory of the immortal Jenner?</p>

<p>The advocates of compulsory vaccination were accustomed
to cite countries like Austria, where the practice
was enforced, for English imitation. Let us then compare,
said Mr. Gibbs, the death-rate of the chief centres
of English population with the death-rate of the chief
divisions of Austria, and note which had the advantage
in the years 1850-51&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">These figures required no commentary. If vaccination
had stopped smallpox in Austria, it evidently had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
reduced mortality even to the level of the most insanitary
English towns.</p>

<p>Assuming, said Mr. Gibbs, that vaccination is entitled
to all the credit claimed for it, let us endeavour to estimate
the gain, if it should be enforced. The yearly
average of deaths from all causes, in England and Wales,
is 370,000, of which about 7,000 are from smallpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This 7,000, then, is the limit of gain which enforced Vaccination
could confer; but from the 7,000 should be deducted about one-third
for deaths from Smallpox among the Vaccinated; and from
the remainder should be deducted an equivalent for the deaths
caused immediately and remotely by Vaccination; and another
equivalent for the deaths resulting from the Law of Vicarious
Mortality. This done, it would require no little ingenuity to discover
a balance in favour of Vaccination.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Having thus argued the matter out, was not Mr. Gibbs
justified in asking&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What would be thought of the tinker who would knock a hole in
the bottom of his saucepan lest one should be burned there in the
ordinary way?</p>

<p>Yet it is just what the vaccinator does; and when he finds&mdash;as he
might have foreseen, had he been governed by common sense&mdash;that
his saucepan does not wear a bit the better, but rather the
worse, he gravely endeavours to excuse the failure, by asserting
that unfortunately he made the hole too big, or too little, too
much on this side, or too much on that, or by offering some other
equally wise excuse.</p></div>

<p>Lastly, there were the political and moral considerations
involved in compulsory vaccination&mdash;the first
attempt in England to confer on a medical prescription
the force of law&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Surely, a wise Government may perceive that there are greater
evils than the occasional outbreak of an epidemic. The systematic
violation of human rights and natural affections, the uprooting from
the human breast of feelings of self-reliance, a state religion in
physic, coercion which may well be regarded as odious persecution,
the belief of the poor that what they hold dearest is sacrificed to
the selfish prejudices of the rich&mdash;any one of these is far worse than
a pestilence.</p>

<p>Cannot they who believe in Vaccination protect themselves?
Nobody seeks to hinder them; nobody presumes to dispute their
right to adopt any medical practice, however questionable it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
be. Why cannot they act with like forbearance to others? Surely,
if freedom be more than a name, it implies the right of the freeman
to reject not only that which other men may choose to regard
as evil, but even that which they may combine to urge upon him
as good....</p>

<p>How absurd that an attempt should be made to visit with punishment
the want of belief in a scientific, or rather unscientific, dogma!
How absurd to pretend to the possession of a prophylactic of such
unquestionable potency that its acceptance requires the threat of
force! In their anxiety to coerce others, compulsory vaccinators
demonstrate their own defect of faith in the prescription which they
assert affords complete security from Smallpox.</p></div>

<p>As observed, the service of Mr. Gibbs is entitled to
special commemoration, because it was the first attempt
to put the arguments against vaccination into systematic
shape. He demonstrated the quackery of the practice,
and the fallacies wherewith it was defended; and denounced
the tyranny of the legislation that would compel
those who recognised the imposture to submit to it.
The service thus rendered by Mr. Gibbs constituted a
ground of vantage for further operations: those who had
to contend against the delusion had their hands strengthened,
and their power of assault magnified, by what he
was favoured to accomplish.</p>

on 25th May, 1811. Owing to the unsettled life of his
father as Captain of the Royal Cork Volunteers, his education
was desultory&mdash;at various schools, and under
various masters. Sagacious, bright, earnest, and independent,
he early manifested a passion for such things as
made for human welfare, and improvement. Abstinence
from alcohol, in connection with Father Mathew’s
mission, had in him an enthusiastic advocate. A book
by Captain Claridge on the water cure excited his interest,
and led to the formation of the Enniscorthy
Hydropathic Society. Anxious to master the mysteries
of this new treatment of disease, he set out for Silesia in
1843, and placed himself under the instruction of Priessnitz,
remaining with him as a chosen disciple until 1847,
when he left with a certificate of competency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst acquiring his art with Priessnitz, he communicated
his experiences to his Enniscorthy friends, who
published them in the Wexford newspapers, a selection
from which was reproduced as <cite>Letters from Grœfenberg</cite>,
in 1847. A passage in one of these letters, dated 27th
November, 1844, indicates the manner in which his attention
was drawn to smallpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another case of Smallpox has just been treated by Priessnitz.
The patient is the daughter of a peasant in the neighbourhood, and
is about twenty years old. She was confined for eight days, and
was most profusely covered with the eruption. An Italian physician
said that he never saw the symptoms come out better. She
had at first the usual treatment&mdash;wet sheets, wet rubbings, and
tepid baths; and, after the eruption appeared, three wet sheets and
three tepid baths daily. She will not have the slightest mark.
Under the water cure Smallpox appears to be deprived of half its
terrors; as far as my observation extends, it neither robs man of
life, nor women of beauty.</p></div>

<p>On his return, he assisted Dr. Lovell in opening a
hydropathic establishment at Barking, Essex; and, in
1848, he undertook the medical superintendence of the
Grande Chartreuse in Piedmont. There he met Miss
Anna Skelton, to whom he was married, at Nice, in 1849.
Ultimately he made his home at St. Leonards, Sussex.
The passage of the Compulsory Vaccination Act, in 1853,
led him to publish a pamphlet, <cite>Our Medical Liberties</cite>,
1854, which excited the attention and won the approval
of many thoughtful people. At the suggestion of Mr.
Thomas Baker, he constructed a letter from the substance
of the pamphlet, and addressed it to the President of the
Board of Health, which, as we have seen, was issued as
a parliamentary paper. The more vehement controversy
which sprang up in recent years when the Vaccination
Act was tightened, found Mr. Gibbs in health too feeble
for active exertion. After his wife’s death, he retired to
Jersey to be near his sister, Mrs. General Lane, in whose
house he died in the winter of 1875.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">SIMON’S DEFENCE AND HAMERNIK’S JUDGMENT.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">An attack on Vaccination like that delivered by John
Gibbs had to be met, and Mr. John Simon, Medical Officer
to the Board of Health, was selected for the purpose.
The answer appeared in 1857 in a quarto blue-book entitled
<cite>Papers relating to the History and Practice of
Vaccination</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> 83 pages consisting of a defence of Vaccination,
and 188 pages of illustrative and corroborative
documents. Oddly enough the treatise of Mr. Gibb is
never once mentioned, whilst the order of defence is
obviously marshalled in front of his positions. The
reason for this reserve was double: first, it was considered
unadvisable to magnify or advertise so dangerous
an antagonist; and second, it is considered unprofessional
to discuss a medical question with one who is not in
medical orders.</p>

<p>In reviewing Mr. Simon’s defence we are constantly
reminded of Mill’s observation, that a doctrine is never
truly judged until it is judged in its best form; and of
Coleridge’s caution, that an adversary’s bad arguments
are no evidence of the goodness of our own. It lay in
the nature of things that many absurd and trumpery
objections should be advanced against vaccination, but to
cite and sneer at them was neither to appreciate nor to
refute the objections that were valid. Had Simon been
less scornful and less loftily disposed, condescending to
deal with his antagonist verbatim, he might have proved
no more successful, but he would have had at least the
praise of judicial intention.</p>

<p>After the custom of the eulogists of vaccination, Mr.
Simon opened with a chapter on “Smallpox before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
Discovery of Vaccination,” consisting of terrible tales of
the ravages of the disease among Mexicans, Indians,
Greenlanders, Icelanders, Siberians, Hottentots, etc., as if
disbelievers in vaccination were under any obligation to
dispute them. It is not denied that smallpox may be a
deadly epidemic: the contention is that vaccination
would not abate its deadliness. At the same time, when
terrible tales are told of the devastations of smallpox, it
is but fair to press for proofs of their authenticity.
Travellers and historians occasionally prefer the excitement
of wonder to adherence to matter-of-fact. When,
for instance, Mr. Simon gravely relates that “in Mexico
3½ millions were suddenly smitten down, leaving none
to bury them,” it is permissible to inquire who was
responsible for the Mexican census in the days of Cortez,
and who counted the unburied dead? Further, it is idle
to attach importance to isolated statements about smallpox,
as if smallpox were an independent destroyer of
mankind. It is a member of a group of destroyers, and
its activity is usually coincident with a correspondent
dormancy among its associates. Until the complete vital
statistics of a community are in evidence, it is vain to
assert whom smallpox present has slain, or absent has
saved. It is the prevalence of death, and not the mode
of death, that is the critical question.</p>

<p>Again, when the familiar list of great folk who died of
smallpox in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries is run
over, the remark occurs, that considering the habits and
habitations of the said great folk, their fate was in nowise
surprising. Those who believe that smallpox is generated
in unwholesome conditions of life are not to be confounded
by facts that illustrate their contention. And
the like is to be said of the equally familiar tale of
London smallpox. It was to be expected that citizens
housed and fed as Londoners were housed and fed should
have been plagued with smallpox and its congeners.
What is denied is that vaccination could have saved
them from smallpox, or reduced their death-rate, their
conditions of life remaining the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>The extravagant exhibition of the horrors of smallpox
is the customary preliminary to the presentation of
Jenner as the saviour from them; and the part of showman
in this respect was fulfilled with more than ordinary
abandon by Simon, who thus depicted the situation and
the rescue&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Medicine baffled and helpless! For millions of our race in after
times the continued raging of that pitiless plague! A drearier
picture could scarcely have saddened mankind.</p>

<p>That this despair was not lasting is due to the genius of an
English surgeon; and the close of the 18th Century, which had
much to darken it, will be remembered till the end of human
history for the greatest physical good ever yet given by science to
the world.</p></div>

<p>Then followed the Jennerian legend, related in highly
fabulous form with sundry extensions from Simon’s
private fancy. It is sufficient to reassert that Jenner did
not introduce cowpox. On the contrary, he rejected
cowpox for horsegrease cowpox; and such was his prescription
because he knew from the evidence of his
neighbourhood that cowpox afforded no protection from
smallpox. It is true that when Pearson discredited horsegrease
cowpox, and recommended cowpox, Jenner dropped
his prescription, and put himself forward as the discoverer
of cowpox; but it is also true that in subsequent
years he resumed his original position, and indeed dispensed
with the cow altogether, and, like Sacco of Milan
and De Carro of Vienna, used and diffused horsegrease
or horsepox neat, describing the equine virus as “the
true and genuine life-preserving fluid.” Of all this,
however, Simon was either ignorant, or preferred to say
nothing. He, too, dropped cowpox as a disease of the
cow. Referring to a conjecture by Jenner that cowpox
was “smallpox in a milder form,” he maintained that the
conjecture had been verified by Gassner in 1801; by
Thiele in 1836; by Ceely in 1839; and commercially by
Badcock of Brighton in 1840. Again and again Badcock
derived fresh stocks of vaccine virus from cows artificially
infected with smallpox; having vaccinated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
such virus more than 14,000 persons, and having furnished
supplies of it to more than 400 medical practitioners&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been made matter of almost familiar experiment that the
infection of Smallpox may, by inoculation, be communicated from
Man to Cow; that its result is an eruption of vesicles presenting
the physical characters of Cowpox; that the lymph from these
vesicles, if implanted in the skin of the human subject, produces
the ordinary local phenomena of Vaccination; that the person so
vaccinated diffuses no atmospheric infection; that the lymph generated
by him may be transferred, with reproductive powers, to
other unprotected persons; and that, on the conclusion of this artificial
disorder, <em>neither renewed Vaccination, nor inoculation with
Smallpox, nor the closest contact and cohabitation with smallpox
patients, will occasion him to betray any remnant of susceptibility
to infection</em>. (P. xiv.)</p></div>

<p>Thus were the discredited claims of Jenner revived
and reasserted for a new variety of virus&mdash;for smallpox
inoculated on the cow! Even revaccination was pronounced
impossible, and logically; for revaccination
implies susceptibility to infection. It was idle, however,
to shelter this new development under Jenner’s authority.
When Jenner said that cowpox was smallpox in milder
form, he meant in process the reverse of Simon’s interpretation.
He meant that smallpox came to man from
the horse through the cow; and not that the cow contracted
smallpox from man. Showing his nephew a
horse with greasy heels, he said, “There is the source of
smallpox.”<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> When the stock of cowpox for vaccination
ran low, Jenner feared it might be difficult to enlarge
the supply. Why? Because farmers exercised such
precaution, since they learnt that cowpox was derived
from horsegrease, that the disease among cows had
become well nigh extinct. Possibly Jenner was mistaken:
possibly cowpox originated in smallpox: but what Simon
described as “settled” in 1857 exists to this day in
vehement dispute. Simon’s prescription was practically
a fresh discovery&mdash;a new departure in vaccination. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
recalls the practice of the variolators who took virus
for timid patients from healthy subjects inoculated with
mild smallpox; the supposition being that the virulence
of the mild pox was meliorated in them, they playing the
part that Ceely and Badcock assigned to the cow. Thus
when Dimsdale variolated the Empress Catharine, it was
with smallpox mitigated in the person of a strong young
man. Had Dimsdale substituted a cow for a man, he
would not only have anticipated Jenner, but the later
revelation and practice of Ceely and Badcock&mdash;“the
greatest physical good ever given by science to the
world.”</p>

<p>Simon next went on to describe “Smallpox since the
Use of Vaccination,” concerning which these observations
may suffice&mdash;</p>

<p>1st&mdash;Smallpox was abating over Europe prior to the
introduction of vaccination, notwithstanding the stimulation
of the disease by variolation.</p>

<p>2nd&mdash;The discredit cast upon variolation by vaccination
threw smallpox out of culture, and to that extent
abated smallpox.</p>

<p>3rd&mdash;It was absurd to ascribe the decline of smallpox
to vaccination in countries where only a part of the
people were vaccinated; and usually, as in England, a
part least liable to smallpox.</p>

<p>These considerations, sufficiently developed in preceding
chapters, nullify the conclusion, supported by elaborate
statistical tables, that vaccination was the cause of the
decline in smallpox. The asserted cause was incommensurate
with the effect.</p>

<p>Another remark remains, namely, that all vaccination
was taken by Simon for effective vaccination, except
where smallpox followed, and then suspicion was thrown
on the virus or the time and mode of its administration.
But under his own definition of virus, namely, smallpox
inoculated on the cow, the greater part, if not the
whole, of the vaccinations accomplished were with virus
altogether diverse&mdash;with cowpox that owed nothing to
smallpox, with equine cowpox, with horsepox, and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
else known only to omniscience. Yet it was to these
heterogeneous inoculations, modified inscrutably in transit
from patient to patient, that the subsidence of smallpox
was attributed! In a word, whatever was anywhere or
by anybody <em>called</em> vaccination, served, according to
Simon, to exterminate smallpox. Where shall we find
an epithet for such crass assurance, with neither science
or common-sense to lend it the gloss of probability!</p>

<p>The succeeding chapter, “Alleged Drawbacks from the
Advantages of Vaccination, and alleged Dangers of its
Practice,” was as abusive as unfair. It is admitted that
much nonsense has been written against vaccination, and,
if the pot may call the kettle black, much more nonsense
has been circulated in its favour. Vaccination was
recommended for the improvement of health and the
complexion, for the cure of skin diseases, for the Plague,
for whooping-cough, for rot in sheep, and for distemper
in dogs&mdash;Jenner himself vaccinating the King’s staghounds.
But to what purpose such recrimination? The
prime charge against vaccination is, that it is a disease
which neither averts or mitigates smallpox; and the
second is, that it frequently excites and sometimes conveys
other diseases.</p>

<p>Simon waxed eloquent on the absurdity of referring
the origin of certain scrofulous affections to vaccination,
whilst describing such affections as notorious sequences
of smallpox; but where was the absurdity if vaccination
was (as he held) a mild form of smallpox?&mdash;the mild
disease serving equally as a ferment or excitant of
evil humours. In his furious contempt he forgot his
science and logic, and implicitly conceded all for which
rational adversaries of vaccination contended.</p>

<p>In the same reckless vein he asked, “Is properly performed
vaccination an absolutely inoffensive proceeding?”
and answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not at all, nor does it pretend to be so. The very meaning of
the thing is, that it shall artificially and designedly produce a
transient and trifling indisposition; that for some days the infant
shall be uncomfortable with a sore arm and a slight irritation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
the adjacent axillary glands, and a perceptible amount of general
feverishness. (P. lx.)</p></div>

<p>Here we agree, and here disagree&mdash;agree as to the disease,
disagree as to the determination of its limits. First,
the virus is in quality indefinite; and second, the recipient
of the virus is a complex of qualities indefinite;
so that, as Dr. Mead observed, when smallpox was used
for inoculation, “it is more material into what kind of
body it be infused, than out of what it is taken.” As
pathologists freely allow, it is impossible to predicate the
transformations of organic poisons in the animal frame.
A vigorous infant may throw off the virus, designated
vaccine, and suffer no apparent harm, but the same virus
may operate very differently in contact with debility and
disease; so that, in the words of James, we have to say,
“Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!” The
conditions of vaccination are essentially those of hazard;
the issues are those of a game of chance; the result at
the best being a risk for naught.</p>

<p>Simon, too, was positive as to the impossibility of the
invaccination of syphilis&mdash;a fact no longer in question,
save as to the degree of frequency. And here, also, in his
recklessness he forgot consistency, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a child is born with the heritage of syphilis (a very frequent
incident, if its parents have been suffering from that infection)
the characteristic symptoms do not appear till some weeks
after birth; and then the scandal discloses itself. (P. lxvi.)</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Just so; and before disclosure the child is vaccinated, and
serving as vaccinifer, the latent syphilis is inoculated and
diffused.</p>

<p>Vaccination, according to Simon, was easy&mdash;“The mere
manual trick is learnt from a minute’s teaching and an
hour’s practice.” Difficulty begins in the selection of
proper subjects for the rite, for which none are qualified,
save the healthy; and for the recognition of health a
trained eye is wanted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If sickly children are vaccinated, children breeding other disorders,
children having skin disease, children teething and the like,
the results must be at least unsatisfactory, and possibly dangerous.
(P. lxii.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>If such children are exempted from vaccination, how
can vaccination ever approach universality? And when
universal vaccination is effected, as it is frequently effected,
how can it fail to be attended with “results, at least unsatisfactory,
and possibly dangerous”?</p>

<p>More difficult than the selection of subjects is the selection
of virus for the rite; and the manifold dangers and
the requisite precautions were thus specified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Especially as regards the quality of vaccine lymph, the careless
or uneducated vaccinator is using a dangerous weapon. It is only
during part of the course of a vaccine vesicle that its lymph is suitable
for further vaccinations: for after a given moment, at which
the contents of the vesicle possess their maximum of simple contagiousness,
they tend more and more toward the quality of common
inflammatory products; and matter now taken from the
vesicle is no longer the simple agent of a specific infection, but has
less efficiency for its real purpose, and is specially able to produce
other undesired results.</p>

<p>A danger of somewhat similar kind is that of taking lymph from
vesicles which already have been accidentally ruptured, or where
from any other cause, local or constitutional, their specific fluid is
likely to have been modified by common irritative processes.</p>

<p>The danger of taking matter from irritated vesicles, and from
vesicles at too advanced a period of their course, is one which circumstances
render frequent; and there is reason to believe that,
in at least a very large proportion of those cases where abnormal
effects have resulted from so-called vaccination, it has been the employment
of this ambiguous irritative matter which has occasioned
the mischief and scandal.</p>

<p>Still more critical changes occur in lymph when removed from
the body, unless appropriate means be taken to preserve it; for,
under the influence of air and moisture, it tends, like other dead
organic matter, to putrid decomposition; and inoculation with it,
when thus changing, can hardly be more useful or less dangerous
than a casual scratch inflicted in the dissecting room. (P. lxii.)</p></div>

<p>No one who considers this limitation of vaccination to
the healthy, and these prescriptions as to the collection
and exhibition of “lymph,” can fail to see that the charges
of injury and death brought against the common practice
were allowed and accounted for&mdash;were, indeed, the
unavoidable associates of that practice. Vaccination, as
described by Simon, was an ideal operation&mdash;impracticable
on any ordinary terms. His contention and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
approbation were reserved for “properly-performed vaccination”
on a healthy child, with innocuous virus, the
proof of each condition being discovered in the result.
If unsatisfactory or injurious, or deadly, then the vaccination
could not have been “properly performed”&mdash;either
the child was unhealthy, or the virus was at fault.</p>

<p>Nor can we wonder that the people, having experience of
the uselessness and misery of the virulent practice should,
undismayed by the terror of smallpox, decline its observance;
nor that those who made gain thereby should,
distrusting their power to prevail by reason, invoke legislation
to enforce the imposture, calling in the policeman
to support the doctor, as of old the soldier supported the
priest.</p>

<p>Still further to sustain his case, Simon addressed the
following Circular of Questions to upwards of 500 medical
men&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I.&mdash;<em>Have you any doubt that successful Vaccination confers on
persons subject to its influence a very large exemption from attacks
of Smallpox, and almost absolute security against death by that
disease?</em></p>

<p>II.&mdash;<em>Have you any reason to believe or suspect that vaccinated
persons, in being rendered less susceptible of Smallpox, become
more susceptible of any other infective disease, or of phthisis; or
that their health is in any other way disadvantageously affected?</em></p>

<p>III.&mdash;<em>Have you any reason to believe or suspect that lymph,
from a true Jennerian vesicle, has ever been a vehicle of syphilitic,
scrofulous, or other constitutional infection to the vaccinated person;
or that unintentional inoculation with some other disease,
instead of the proposed Vaccination, has occurred in the hands of
a duly educated medical practitioner?</em></p>

<p>IV.&mdash;<em>Do you (assuming due provisions to exist for a skilful
performance of the operation) recommend that, except for special
reasons in individual cases, Vaccination should be universally
performed at early periods of life?</em></p></div>

<p>Whilst these questions were framed to draw the
answers required, yet, however modified, the tenor of
the returns would have been much the same. We might
confidently predict uniform replies, if a circular were
addressed to 500 clergymen soliciting their judgment as
to the disendowment of the Church, to 500 Nonconformist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
divines as to the benefit of hearing sermons, to 500
military men as to the expediency of an imminent war,
to 500 naval officers as to an enlargement of the navy, or
to 500 publicans as to the justice of local option. Nor
is there sense in attributing value to testimony to be had
on demand by the yard. It is brought forth as of course,
and to expect otherwise is to expect what is contrary to
nature.</p>

<p>It will be said, “Do you really mean that medical men
defend vaccination because it pays?” In no other sense,
I reply, than as clergymen or publicans defend their
vested interests. Medical men among themselves make
no secret of their pecuniary interest in vaccination, as
any one may see who reads their journals; and Simon’s
advocacy culminated in a demand for more liberal pay,
as the only guarantee for “properly-performed vaccination.”</p>

<p>We may view the matter in another light. Suppose
a circular had been addressed to 500 medical men fifty
years ago, as to the utility of bleeding, or blistering, or
salivation, would not the tenor of the answers have been
equally uniform with Simon’s in favour of vaccination?
Where are these practices now? But suppose any one
of them had obtained legislative sanction and endowment,
can we doubt that it would have survived to this
day, certified as salutary and harmless by the gross of
the medical profession? Let us clear our minds of cant.
The assumption that men’s convictions (I except the
moral aristocracy) are not controlled by their selfish interests
(often enough the reverse of their true ones) is
cant.</p>

<p>Among those interrogated was Dr. Joseph Hamernik
of Prague, whose developed answers form a paper <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'which, by resaon'">which,
by reason</ins> of the independence, acumen and philosophy
displayed, constitutes the distinction of Simon’s collection
of documents.</p>

<p>First, Hamernik inquired whether cowpox and smallpox
had any relation to each other, deciding that they
were diverse and independent diseases. Vaccinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
persons may be attacked with smallpox during the development
of the cowpox vesicle, or a few days after the
drying-up of the same. When inoculation is made with
a mixture of cowpox and smallpox, there ensue a vaccine
vesicle on the site of the puncture and a variolous eruption
over the body. In fact, it is not uncommon to find
cowpox and smallpox flourishing simultaneously on the
same individual. Under some conditions, the one disease
appears to stifle the other. Thus a powerful epidemic of
smallpox will prevent the development of cowpox, illustrating
the Hippocratic aphorism, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duobus doloribus
simul obortis&mdash;vehementior obscurat alterum</i>, exactly as
happens when other diseases simultaneously invade the
human organism. Again, in well-marked epidemics, cowpox
does not protect from smallpox, even after repeated
vaccinations. Under stress of such experience, the confidence
in such vaccination was much shaken in England
during the epidemics of 1825 and 1838. Vaccination was
likewise found useless in the epidemics of Paris in 1825
and Marseilles in 1828. “Nor can revaccination achieve
what vaccination cannot,” said Dr. Brown of Musselburgh.
The revaccinated die of smallpox like other people, as is
proved by the official returns of the armies of Wurtemburg
and Prussia&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Revaccinations among civilians in Bohemia are extremely rare,
and hence I am unable to cite many cases. I only saw two persons
who had been revaccinated die at the Prague Hospital&mdash;a
Russian officer in the guards, and a physician from Bremen.</p>

<p>There is no validity in the statement that epidemics of Smallpox
are arrested and made milder by rapid Vaccination and Revaccination;
unless medical men could test the accuracy of their
verdict, as lawyers do, by a new trial. Until they can do so, we
must admit that there are cases and epidemics of Smallpox light
and severe. It was so before Vaccination was heard of, and is
likely so to continue longer than Vaccination will endure.</p></div>

<p>Second, turning to the examination of the characters
of smallpox before and after vaccination, he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If Vaccination really possessed the properties ascribed to it, a
change must long ere this have taken place in the character of
Smallpox, both of the sporadic and epidemic kind. Smallpox has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
been minutely described by pathologists before Vaccination was
introduced, and in such a manner that one would think they had
seen the disease in the wards of our hospitals. Indeed the best
pathologists of our time, who have paid special attention to Smallpox,
agree that they could add nothing to the descriptions of Rhazes
(who died at Bagdad <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 930), of Sydenham, 1675, of Richard
Mead, 1754, and of John Huxham, 1764. Mead admits a light and
severe Smallpox, and Huxham observed such slight epidemics that
no fever appeared in the whole course of the disease. At present,
pathologists would hardly class such cases with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Variola Vera</i>; they
would, perhaps, call them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Variola Modificata</i>; or let them figure
in their tables as <em>Varioloid</em> and proofs of the good results of Vaccination.</p>

<p>It may be that in former centuries Smallpox assumed more frequently
the malignant or hæmorrhagic type; but this circumstance
can in nowise be explained by the intervention of Vaccination.
Even as many individuals of the animal and vegetable kingdoms
have disappeared, so also have great changes taken place in the
number and severity of diseases. When scurvy, putrid fevers,
dysentery, etc., were commoner, Smallpox was likely to be more
malignant: so much was due to the prevalent poverty and scarcity
throughout Europe. Pauperism, want and hunger, are always
characterised by a proportionate frequency, gravity and diffusion
of various diseases.</p></div>

<p>Then, too, much of the mortality of smallpox in former
times was attributable to maltreatment; and Hamernik
illustrated what was possible under good treatment, by
adducing his own experience when the smallpox wards
in Prague were under his care. “The recoveries were,
very speedy, and the deaths less than five per cent.”</p>

<p>Third, he held that the doctrine of Jenner was opposed
to recognised pathological principles. Observation has
taught us that two severe diseases cannot affect an individual
at the same time. Thus typhus cannot go on with
scarlet fever or smallpox, nor tuberculous with cancerous
disease. The rule, however, only holds good with diseases
that affect the whole organism. It does not apply
to trifling or local affections, to which latter category
cowpox belongs. The best marked diseases pursue their
course contemporaneously with cowpox; and the scars of
the punctures through which it has been inoculated have
no more influence in averting smallpox than any similar
scars resulting from analogous cutaneous lesion&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I consider it as a general pathological law that morbid actions
which have entirely run their course can have absolutely no influence
whatever upon the subsequent pathological reactions of the
individual. Hence it is possible to suffer repeatedly from smallpox,
scarlet fever, typhus, pneumonia, tubercular disease, etc. Nay,
Smallpox has been observed five different times upon the same
patient. Keeping these incontestable facts in view, it becomes a
matter of indifference what was Jenner’s doctrine relative to Cowpox,
whether identical with Smallpox, or whether antagonistic to
Smallpox or anything else. Nor can Variolation be advocated, if
we pay attention to the same pathological law. A variolous attack,
when once passed away, has no more influence, as regards future
events, than any other disease. The reason why many escape
Smallpox altogether, why some have it twice, why the inoculation
of the disease has sometimes no effect, or why some can inhale its
effluvia with impunity, is entirely concealed from us. As Cowpox
is a disease foreign to man, it is particularly for graziers that further
investigations can be interesting.</p></div>

<p>In answer to the Second Question, whether vaccinated
persons, being less susceptible to smallpox, become more
susceptible of any other infective disease, or of phthisis,
Hamernik answered that the interrogation implied what,
for reasons given, he disputed, namely, that the vaccinated
were less liable to smallpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The assumption is perfectly gratuitous. Epidemics of Smallpox
occur at widely varying periods, with different degrees of intensity,
prevalence, and duration. The Vaccinated and the Unvaccinated
suffer in every epidemic; and the influence of Vaccination cannot
be determined from the character and progress of the disease in
individual cases.</p>

<p>I am aware that the beneficial influence of Vaccination is inferred
from the registers of public vaccinators; but I freely confess I consider
these books as perfectly valueless; and I may add that the most
intelligent of the gentlemen who keep them fully concur in my
opinion. In this country we know full well how vaccinators are
situated; and that little confidence can be placed in them is generally
acknowledged.</p></div>

<p>To the Third Question, whether syphilitic, scrofulous,
and other constitutional affections are communicable in
vaccination, Hamernik answered with regret in the affirmative.
It was true that the contrary opinion was written
at large. Taupin testified that he had taken virus from
children suffering from typhus, scarlet fever, measles,
smallpox, itch, inflammation of the brain, the lungs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
the intestines; from chorea, epilepsy, scrofula, tuberculosis,
and ring-worm, and no harm had resulted to the
vaccinated; and Launauzy agrees with Taupin, that it is
mere prejudice and groundless to suppose that cowpox
taken, from unhealthy children can inflict any hurt&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On this head, it will be sufficient for me to remark that to arrive
at a knowledge of the amount of mischief such doctrine has brought
upon mankind, it would be necessary to learn how much the promulgators
gained by their unlimited favour for Vaccination.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Professor Waller, of Prague, has proved that syphilis
may be inoculated by means of a patient’s blood; and as
blood is often drawn with the virus of vaccination, no
doubt can exist as to the possibility of doing in this
manner a vast amount of mischief. Monteggio taught at
Milan in 1814, that when a syphilitic child is vaccinated,
the result is a vesicle containing both kinds of virus;
and Carioli expressed the same opinion in 1821. Marcolini
relates that, on 16th June, 1814, ten children were
vaccinated from a syphilitic infant, who died at the end
of a few months, and five of the ten children syphilised
from her.</p>

<p>In answer to the Fourth Question, whether vaccination
should be universally performed at early periods of life?
Hamernik replied, that he obviously could not recommend
a practice which put health, and even life itself, in
jeopardy for no certain advantage. Any efficient examination
of virus was impracticable. Vaccinators may
set to work with zeal and care, but their energy soon
cools, and they settle into perfunctory routine. Government
should assume a passive attitude toward vaccination;
or if people <em>will</em> be vaccinated, something might be
done to minimise the danger. If the practice is assigned
to salaried functionaries, they are sure to create evidence
to justify and perpetuate their official existence. Left to
common option&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vaccinations would every year become fewer, until at last we
should read with astonishment in old newspapers how much attention
was once paid to the practice.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the majority of Simon’s correspondents conjured
up arguments for vaccination, their facts, apart
from their rhetoric, conveyed much that was instructive.
For instance, a register was produced of the deaths in
Christ’s Hospital, London, for the century, 1751-1850.
The boys in that charity boarding-school numbered
about 550; and in twenty-five years, 1751-75, there died
of smallpox 22, and in twenty-five years, 1776-1800,
there died 9. In the fifty succeeding years, 1801-50,
there died 1, and he in 1820. Thereon we are asked to
recognise the efficacy of vaccination! But what reduced
the mortality from 22 in 1751-75 to 9 in 1776-1800?
And if 550 boys in the centre of London, in the flux of
constant coming and going, escaped with so few fatalities
from smallpox, what comes of the asserted omnipresence
and havoc of the disease in London before the introduction
of vaccination? Across the street from Christ’s
Hospital stands Newgate, which, during the same years,
was haunted with jail fever; which fever was gradually
suppressed, and by what charm? Certainly by no rite
analogous to vaccination. Why, then, should we be required
to admit an agency in the reduction of smallpox
which played no part in the reduction of a cognate disease?
In times when smallpox was frequent in Christ’s
Hospital, about as little regard was paid to stench and
ventilation as in the prison over the way. In later years
a more wholesome atmosphere prevailed, and concurrently
the diet of the scholars was altered and improved&mdash;changes
in themselves as sufficient to account for the
disappearance of smallpox from the school as for typhus
from the jail.</p>

<p>The like indifference to variations of circumstance
vitiated throughout the generalisations of Simon and his
correspondents. Assuming that the conditions of life
and the characters of disease remained unaltered, smallpox
was treated as uninfluenced by aught but vaccination.
It needs no words to condemn such procedure as
radically unsound; and men, otherwise sane, only persist
in it as they persist in similar hallucinations. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
matter of vaccination they left undefined, or differently
defined. Whatever was called vaccination was taken for
vaccination, and the reduction of smallpox ascribed to it.
In Jenner’s hands it was first horsegrease cowpox, then
cowpox, and lastly horsepox. According to Simon true
vaccination was effected with smallpox inoculated on the
cow. Which, we demand, was the virus that wrought
the numerous miracles we are summoned to believe? Is
it indeed true that there is nothing certain about vaccination
save the vaccinator’s fee? Is it that, as in other
thaumaturgical performances, virtue resides in the performer,
described by Simon as “the duly educated medical
practitioner?” Is it argued that vaccination is a
species of incantation, and that it matters little what
is the vehicle of the rite, its efficacy being dependent on
the credentials of the administrator? Or that what is
believed to be good against smallpox <em>is</em> good against
smallpox, the charm consisting in the faith wherewith it
is received?</p>

<p>The belief in vaccination and its proofs is much
akin to the belief in witchcraft and its proofs. To
argue about witchcraft, and to answer its proofs, was to
become a sort of partner in the delusion. Deliverance
lay in the unqualified denial of the imposture; and from
that firm ground difficulty was solved and the inexplicable
disappeared. As soon as the position of absolute
disbelief is taken up, the plausibilities in favour of vaccination
resolve themselves into the element of phantasy,
so powerful and yet so evanescent. The arts of its advocates
then become manifest with all the dodges, conscious
and unconscious, whereby the light of truth is shut out,
and the gloom requisite for visions provided. The story
of vaccination is the story of many other impostures
which have bewildered and afflicted mankind, and the
study of one is the revelation of others.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">COMPULSION INTENSIFIED&mdash;1861 AND 1867.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The Vaccination Act of 1853 imposed a forfeit not exceeding
20s. on any parent or guardian who failed to
have a child vaccinated within three months of birth;
but experience revealed a grave defect in the law. There
was no provision for the prosecution of defaulters; and
those who had no faith in vaccination, or accounted it a
nuisance, enjoyed immunity without serious annoyance.
To meet this defect a bill was introduced to Parliament
in 1861, providing that “the guardians or overseers of
any parish may appoint some person to institute and conduct
proceedings for enforcing obedience.” The bill was
passed through the House of Commons under the care
of Mr. Robert Lowe, meeting with little resistance, and
with less in the Lords. In vindicating the measure, 10th
July, 1861, Mr. Lowe observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Parliament in 1853 passed an Act for Compulsory Vaccination,
but owing to a defect in the provision of expenses for prosecution,
it has fallen into desuetude. When the present Government was
formed in 1859, a clause was introduced to the Public Health Act
correcting the defect; but under pressure of the Member for Finsbury
[Mr. Thomas Duncombe] I surrendered it. It has been to
me a bitter reflection that I did so; for I am convinced that the
sacrifice of that clause has occasioned the loss of thousands of
lives in this country.</p></div>

<p>The question is sometimes asked, Why is it that association
with horses is so prejudicial to morality? This
interrogation might be accompanied with another, namely,
Why is it that the advocacy of vaccination is so frequently
associated with romance and rant? That public
vaccination had fallen into desuetude was untrue. There
were fluctuations from year to year, but the rate was
maintained without practical abatement. That in 1861
it could be said that thousands of lives had been lost
because prosecuting officers were not provided in 1859,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
was romance and rant without mitigation. In England
and Wales there died of smallpox&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">

<p class="noindent">Where then were the thousands of lives lost from the
formation of the Government in 1859 to 1861? and
where were the lives saved after the enactment of the
vital clause? But who that knew Mr. Robert Lowe
could believe that he was convinced that the surrender of
the clause occasioned the loss of thousands of lives, and
that the loss was to him a bitter reflection? Would not
the vulgar version of the invocation, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O mihi beate Martine!</i>
have been appropriate to the situation?</p>

<p>Further, continued Mr. Lowe&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From 1837 to 1840 the deaths from Smallpox amounted to 12,000
a-year. From 1840 to 1863, during which period Vaccination was
provided by the Poor Law Boards, the annual average of deaths
was only 5,200. Thus by the diffusion of Vaccination, the mortality
of Smallpox was reduced by more than one-half. Then in 1853
the Compulsory Law came into operation, and its first effect was
remarkable. The number of vaccinations enormously increased
and the deaths diminished. In 1854 they sank to 2,808, and in
1855 to 2,525. Afterwards they gradually increased up to the
present time [When in fact they never were lower!], the Act
having, as I already explained, fallen into desuetude. Thus is the
efficiency of Vaccination established!</p></div>

<p>Into such stuff may a clever man descend! The statement
was rotten with untruth. It was gross misrepresentation
to set forth the average mortality of 12,000 for
the years 1837-40 as permanent mortality which the Act
of 1840 reduced to 5,200. The years 1837-40 embraced
a severe epidemic, following years of quiescence during
which vaccinators had been singing pæans over their
imaginary victory. Holding as we do that smallpox
comes and goes with indifference to vaccination (unless in
so far as it keeps the disease alive) the figures cited by
Mr. Lowe as completely illustrate our contention as they
nullified his. By no contrivance can the fluctuations of
smallpox be associated with more or less vaccination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably Mr. Lowe was inspired by his medical staff,
but, if so, he made the inspiration his own, evolving as
from personal certainty, such fancy-work as this&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Out of 1000 who take Smallpox without being vaccinated 350
die; while out of 1000 badly vaccinated only 150 die; but out of
1000 well vaccinated only 5 die.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">To which the conclusive answer would have been, that a
mortality of 7 in 20 of the unvaccinated was about double
that of smallpox in the time when all were unvaccinated;
and that disregarding the factitious classification, the
mortality over all cases continued as it was in the pre-vaccination
era. What smallpox was, smallpox has remained&mdash;discrete,
confluent, malignant; each type being
qualified as slight, dangerous, and deadly; the relation
of vaccination to the type being wholly irrelevant.</p>

<p>Further, he proclaimed without reserve, that smallpox
was transmuted to cowpox in the cow&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was a theory started that the efficacy of Vaccination was
wearing out; but the valuable discovery of Mr. Ceely has set any
apprehension on that score at rest for ever. Mr. Ceely has proved
that Smallpox, when taken from the human body and introduced
to that of the cow, produces Cowpox. It is thus evident that we
have the means of obtaining Cowpox of the requisite strength to
any extent. The beautiful discovery has also been made that the
security of Vaccination may be almost indefinitely increased by
multiplying the number of punctures.</p></div>

<p>Thus was mystery dispelled! Cowpox was smallpox
diversified in the cow, and the lost security of Jenner’s
single puncture was recovered in tattoo!</p>

<p>Appealing to the sentiment of medical men in favour
of vaccination as exhibited in the replies to Simon’s
queries in 1857&mdash;a fallacy for conviction which Mr. Lowe
would have been quick to detect if advanced for any clerical,
scholastic, or other trading interest, he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The terrible malady falls heavily upon young children: in Vaccination
is their defence. Consider, then, what a painful responsibility
will rest upon us, if, in the face of almost unanimous medical
testimony, we leave them to perish, and communicate a dreadful
contagion throughout the country. These children have no discretion
of their own; and it is a profanation of liberty and self-government
to say that any man has a right to set up his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
sordid and brutal prejudices against such medical opinion, and
expose his child to disease and death.</p></div>

<p>Words, ferocious words; but how do they bear examination?
Why should disbelief in vaccination be
stigmatised as sordid and brutal prejudice? Why should
parliamentary affection for children surpass parental
affection? The argument, if valid, would equally apply to
any matter in which the conviction of a minority was at
variance with that of a majority; and if in such circumstances
the minority is bound to submission, where is the
substance answering to civil and religious liberty? If
the clear scientific persuasion of the smallest minority
concerning such a matter as vaccination is to be subjected
to vulgar medical dictation by the brute force of the
majority, what form of tyranny may not be justified?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Bill [continued Mr. Lowe] which I wish to pass into law is
very simple. All that it enacts is that Poor Law Boards may
appoint persons to prosecute those whom the medical officers report
ought to be prosecuted.</p></div>

<p>And the bill was passed without division. Mr. Duncombe
and Mr. Coningham protested, but neither had
mastered the question so as to offer effective opposition.
Mr. Coningham observed that figures might be made to
prove anything; and as concerned the unanimous opinion
of medical men, they had to bear in mind the saying,
“There is nothing like leather.” If smallpox had fallen
off, there were extensive sanitary improvements to account
for the fall; and, for his part, he placed his trust
much more in better conditions of life for the people than
in a prescription like vaccination.</p>

<p>The Act obtained did not fulfil the expectations of its
promoters. Mr. Lowe’s bitter regret for thousands of
lives lost in consequence of his concession to Mr. Duncombe
proved to be wasted emotion. Guardians did not
exercise their powers as inquisitors and persecutors with
adequate energy. Sir Morton Peto, in the House of Commons,
on 14th March, 1864, asked&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whether the registration of Vaccination is not a total failure,
alike for statistical purposes and for the prosecution of offenders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
under the Compulsory Act; and whether it is the intention of the
Government to amend the law this session.</p></div>

<p>To which Mr. Lowe made answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is quite true that the system of registration under the Act is
very bad, but it would cost a great deal of money to improve it.
Moreover, even when improved, it would not make the measures
for compulsion effectual to any extent. The great difficulty of
working compulsion is not so much due to defective legislation as
to the reluctance to prosecute poor people for disobedience to the
law, the neglect of which is countenanced by too many who ought
to know better. I am sorry, therefore, I cannot hold out any hope
of improving the system.</p></div>

<p>The medical officers of the Poor Law Board were, however,
intent upon coercive legislation; and Mr. H. A.
Bruce, more pliant than Mr. Lowe, introduced a bill of
their contriving in 1866, which he assured the House
of Commons “involved no new principle, and merely
consolidated provisions dispersed over six Acts of
Parliament, <em>with a few amendments</em>.” On going into
committee on the bill, 11th April, 1866, he delivered an
elaborate defence of vaccination, prepared for him by
the astute promoters of the measure, starting in this
fashion&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the close of last century Dr. Jenner achieved his immortal
discovery by which, perhaps, more misery has been prevented
through the alleviation of pain and the preservation of life than by
any other discovery that has ever been made.</p></div>

<p>Spoken from whatever elevation, nothing divides talk
like this from that of a quack at a country fair. Having
struck the note, Mr. Bruce ran through the familiar
gamut of assertion wherewith the rite of vaccination is
supposed to be justified. The following is a sample of
the advocacy imposed upon him&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A statement has been widely circulated that Syphilis has been
communicated by Vaccination. Millions of children have been
vaccinated in the last sixty years, but not a single case has occurred
in which it has been proved that Syphilis has been communicated.
A case is alleged to have occurred in France in which a child had
been vaccinated from another which inherited Syphilis, but the
surgeon in that case, in taking lymph from a child covered with
syphilitic blotches, acted in monstrous disregard of common prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
and medical knowledge. No such case, so far as the most
careful medical research can discover, has happened in this
country.</p></div>

<p>Whilst this statement would now incur general discredit,
yet even in 1866 the official prompters of Mr.
Bruce presumed over much on public credulity. It was
not probable that what vaccinators did not wish they
would discover; or, if discovered, proclaim. Nevertheless,
the denunciation of the “alleged” French instance was
entirely inconsistent with the contention that syphilis
could not be communicated from a syphilitic vaccinifer,
blotched or unblotched. So much it was imperative to
maintain, for it was obvious that the complete vaccination
of any population must involve infants with latent
syphilis whose virus might transfer the disease to the
untainted. This peril, opponents of vaccination, from
Cobbett onwards, had recognised; and as its recognition
was prejudicial to vaccination, its possibility was stoutly
outsworn until manifold and indisputable evidence compelled
its admission, and shifted the question to the
extent of its frequency.</p>

<p>Mr. Henley, following Mr. Bruce, spoke some homely
sense&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We all know that when we want anything of the kind done, the
medical man entertains us with a fine cock-and-bull story about
waiting until he can get lymph from a healthy child. This caution
implies risk; and though it is said that not a single case of injury
has occurred in sixty years, yet nobody will persuade me that
medical men take all these pains (where they are well paid and
watched) if there are not grounds for the exercise of care. Undoubtedly
it was an abomination to take vaccine from a diseased
child, but how is a public vaccinator to know that any child is diseased?
If he inquires too particularly, he will run the risk of a
slapped face from the mother for his trouble.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Henley also drew attention to the claims made for
vaccination, coupled with the admission that the greater
part of it was good for little&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One remarkable statement has been made&mdash;that there has been
an examination of 500,000 children belonging to the humbler
classes chiefly affected by Compulsory Vaccination. Of the number
so examined only one in eight was found to have been perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
vaccinated, which fact involves the further fact that seven out of
the eight were imperfectly vaccinated, or not vaccinated at all. If
only one in eight has been perfectly vaccinated, great doubt will
come upon many people’s minds as to the matter with which the
others have been inoculated.</p></div>

<p>Much in the bill was crude and impracticable, and Mr.
Ayrton expressed the sense of many in the House when
he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bill before us is badly drawn, and bears too much the marks
of its official origin. Great powers have been taken for the vaccinating
department, but nothing is provided for the protection of
the public. It seems to me that if Vaccination is to be enforced
by penalties, public vaccinators should be subject to penalties for
inefficient and injudicious work. I have been entrusted with a
great many petitions against the bill, and I have been much impressed
with the admission that the existing system of Vaccination
has entirely failed in effecting its object. The bill will have to be
referred to a Committee, and as many believe that Vaccination
does as much harm as good, I trust the members will not be
fettered in their inquiries.</p></div>

<p>It is needless to say the asserted failure of vaccination
was an artifice to induce Parliament to pass the bill.
The public vaccinations for 1863, 1864, and 1865, were
as numerous as ever, and accompanied with a marked
increase of smallpox. No doubt vaccination was a
failure, but in a different sense from that in which the
word was used to acquire increase of power and pay for
the application of the rite. The bill was referred to a
select committee, who reported; but the Conservatives
having displaced the Liberals, it was withdrawn. Mr.
Corry, in announcing the fact to the House of Commons,
23rd July, 1866, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have ascertained that the measure is likely to meet with great
opposition on both sides of the House; and it is, therefore, very
doubtful whether it could be carried at this late period of the
session. Moreover, some of its provisions require further and careful
consideration.</p></div>

<p>The bill was framed and promoted by the Poor Law
Board, independently of Liberals and Conservatives, the
problem of the medical officials being, “How far is it
possible to obtain the assent of Parliament to what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
consider desirable.” There were limits to parliamentary
complaisance, however wide, and, informed by the experience
of 1866, a revised bill was introduced to the
House of Commons by Lord Robert Montagu in 1867,
who, like his predecessors, reproduced the instructions of
his advisers with sufficient flavour to pass them off
as his own. A portion of his business was to obtain
recognition for the payment of extra fees for successful
vaccination&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When an Inspector reports that certain Vaccinations are of the
1st class, the Public Vaccinator will receive 1s. over and above
the sum paid by the Guardians for each Vaccination he has performed.
If the Vaccinations are reported of the 2nd class, he
will receive 8d. For 3rd class Vaccinations nothing in excess of
the Guardians’ contract fee will be paid.</p></div>

<p>This graduation of vaccination excited no comment
though why aught save first-class should have been
accounted tolerable, or paid for, was far from obvious.
The possible amount chargeable for these awards was
thus estimated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ratio of children born to the population is about 3½ per cent.,
which gives 700,000 a year for the population of 20 millions.
Reckoning that four-fifths of these children, or 560,000, are vaccinated
gratuitously during the year, the expenditure will be £28,000
if all the Vaccinations are 1st class, and £18,500 if 2nd class.
Shall we, then, think it too much if, for a sum between £18,500
and £28,000 we ensure that there shall never occur a case of smallpox,
and that we save 7,000 lives a year?</p></div>

<p>Such was the argument put into the mouth of Lord
Robert Montagu for the persuasion of Parliament! Only
pay an extra price for first and second class vaccination,
and not a case of smallpox shall occur in England, and
7,000 lives a year shall be saved! When we inquire
where the 7,000 lives a year were lost, we discover how
boldly the credulity of Parliament was imposed upon.
There died of smallpox in England and Wales&mdash;</p>

to hold a license for prevarication, but with medical
officials with M.P.’s for spokesmen. The following years,

<p class="noindent">Smallpox was proclaimed “stamped-out” of Scotland in
1870, but the epidemic of 1871-72 proved how vain was
the boast. Smallpox, in common with typhus, may be
exterminated, but by no such irrelevance as vaccination.</p>

<p>One object of the bill was the reconstruction of vaccination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
districts, so as to secure sufficient numbers for
arm-to-arm practice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is necessary [said Lord R. Montagu] to successful Vaccination
that the two classes of patients, those who have been vaccinated
eight days before should meet those who are to be vaccinated,
so that the doctor may take vaccine from the arms of one set and
transfer it to those of the other.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Henley, in opposition, maintained that careful
vaccination on such terms was impracticable, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It seems a large proportion of the Vaccination provided by the
public is imperfect; but the bill before us is wholly inadequate to
secure Vaccination that is trustworthy. If a vaccinator never sees
a child until it is brought to him, and knows nothing of its parentage,
how can he judge whether it is fit to be vaccinated, or fit to
serve for the vaccination of others? No torture will induce a
mother to confess before company that anything ails her baby.
Every one who knows anything of women is aware that they will
conceal in public what they may reveal in the privacy of home.
The shame of making known her own infirmities, or those of her
family, will keep a woman silent in a crowd, and if she does reply
to awkward questions, it will be to mislead. Medical men will
consequently be perplexed and outwitted; and, therefore, on the
terms prescribed a safe and efficient system of Vaccination cannot
be secured.</p></div>

<p>Further, said Mr. Henley, the bill was defective
because no attempt was made to conciliate the prejudices
or consult the convenience of the people who were compelled
to have their children vaccinated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bill is one of pure coercion, making no allowance for those
who are brought under its scope. It must not be forgotten that the
poor mother is not able to do much within the month after her
confinement. The period of three months specified within which
Vaccination must be effected will press very severely upon the
lower orders. We are told that no district of less than 5,000 inhabitants
will work successfully, and that 10,000 is a better number.
If country districts are to comprise 5,000, how many miles will
poor folk have to travel to reach a vaccination station? Consider
the inconvenience it will be to a woman to drag her child two or
three miles for vaccination, and be obliged to go a second time for
inspection! The medical authorities insist that four punctures at
least ought to be made on the unfortunate children. Not only are
those four wounds to be inflicted, but the children are to be brought
in all weathers to have their wounds opened and matter extracted
for the benefit of others, thus prolonging their sufferings and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
cares of their mothers. If we are to act upon the principle of doing
as we should be done by, I would ask how you would like to be
compelled to carry your children to a vaccination station and have
them mixed up with all and sundry, and inoculated at a hazard
with you know not what? For myself I see no difficulty in having
the children of the poor vaccinated at their own homes. It would
be far better to pay more and work discriminately than let the
people think there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.
If you simply try to drive you will find the people apt to kick, and
still more ready to evade the restrictions you put upon them.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Kendall confirmed Mr. Henley, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As Chairman of a large Union, I have seen great inconvenience
from the crowding of children at vaccination stations. They are
taken to those stations whether wet or dry, and cold and shivering
are kept huddled together in a manner most likely to breed illness
and diffuse infection.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lowe sneered at Mr. Henley’s concern for the
poor, reminding him that the wounds he deplored would
save them from a loathsome disease. Mr. Henley did
not dispute the salvation, as he might have done, but
pleaded for its more considerate performance. Spite, too,
of his assumption, there <em>is</em> one law for the rich and
another for the poor. Compulsory vaccination as applied
to the majority would never be tolerated by the upper
and middle class minority; nor would a plutocratic
Parliament have entertained so profane a project. Nor
(it must be said) would working men show themselves
much more enduring in their own persons. The victims
of the law are their wives and children; and it is surprising
how much indignity and cruelty they will endure
in these helpless dependents. Mr. Henley was more
chivalrous for them than they are for themselves.</p>

<p>An argument for fresh legislation was the failure of
the Act of 1853. Mr. Brady said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a medical man I can testify that medical men are almost
unanimous in favour of Compulsory Vaccination; but in order to
give the public the full benefit of the system it must be fairly paid
for. We shall be penny wise and pound foolish unless the persons
employed to carry out this measure are liberally remunerated.
When the bill of 1853 was before the House, I said the remuneration
was inadequate, and that the Act would be a failure, and that
prediction has proved true.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Act of 1853 was a failure, in the sense of not
securing the vaccination of the people, was untrue&mdash;though
necessarily true as concerned the prevention of
smallpox. The assertion of failure in 1867 was an artifice
to overcome the apathy of Parliament. It was
assumed that there was a population to be vaccinated,
and vaccinated in a new and superior fashion, if only
better pay were provided. More money was wanted to
work the Vaccination Mill. In the words of Lord Robert
Montagu&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the birth of a child being registered, the Registrar is bound
to give notice to the parent, and to supply him with proper forms,
whether for public or private Vaccination. He will enter in a book
the name of the child, with the means of identification. After
Vaccination, the Public Vaccinator will send the certificate of successful
Vaccination to the Registrar, who will enter it in his book.
Thus the Registrar will know which children have been registered
in his district and which have not; which children are liable to
Smallpox and which are not liable. [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O Credulitas!</i>] Then it is
made the interest of all concerned to work the system and enforce
its checks. It is the interest of every Local Registrar to hunt up
every birth, because for every entry he has 1s. It is his interest to
obtain the certificate of successful Vaccination, for entering which
he has 3d. It is the interest of the Public Vaccinator to operate
on as many children as possible, because for each successful operation
he has at least 1s. 6d., and for first class work an extra 1s. It
is the interest of the parent to have his child vaccinated, for he is
otherwise subject to legal proceedings and a penalty of 20s.</p></div>

<p>Colonel Barttelot objected, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are about 750,000 births annually in this country, and the
parents of the majority surely deserve some consideration. 250,000
of them can neither read or write, yet they are liable to a fine of
20s. if they do not comply with the printed forms of this Act. It
would be much better to send doctors to the homes of the children
than collect mothers and infants in crowds at vaccination stations.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Bruce replied that it was proposed to do nothing
new&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Compulsory Vaccination on the same terms has been the law of
the land since 1853. The present bill lays down no new principle.
It merely collects the scattered provisions of the law, and supplies
machinery found necessary after much experience.</p></div>

<p>The observation was, no doubt, ingenuous on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
of the speaker; but, misled himself, he assisted to mislead
the House. The bill, Section 31, ran as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>If any Registrar, or any Officer appointed by the Guardians to
enforce the provisions of this Act, shall give information in
writing to a Justice of the Peace, that he has reason to believe that
any child under the age of 14 years, being within the Union or
Parish for which the informant acts, has not been successfully
vaccinated, and that he has given notice to the parent or person
having the custody of such child to procure its being vaccinated,
and that this notice has been disregarded, the Justice may summon
such parent or person to appear with the child before him at a
certain time and place, and upon the appearance, if the Justice
shall find, after such examination as he shall deem necessary, that
the child has not been vaccinated, nor has already had the Smallpox,
he may, if he see fit, make an order under his hand and seal
directing such child to be vaccinated within a certain time; and
if, at the expiration of such time, the child shall not have been so
vaccinated, or shall not be shown to be then unfit to be vaccinated,
or to be insusceptible of Vaccination, the person upon whom such
an order shall have been made shall be proceeded against summarily,
and, unless he can show some reasonable ground for his
omission to carry the order into effect, shall be liable to a penalty
not exceeding 20s.</em></p></div>

<p>Yet, said Mr. Bruce, it was proposed to do nothing
new! Here was a development of compulsion subjecting
a parent to prosecution during fourteen years of the life
of his child, and it was nothing new! What resulted
from this aggravation of the law, devised with craft and
enacted with indifference, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The bill was opposed by Sir J. Clarke Jervoise, Mr.
Thomas Chambers, and Mr. Barrow. Mr. Chambers prophesied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am persuaded that when the bill is passed an agitation will
commence which will never cease until the Act is repealed.</p></div>

<p>The carelessness and indifference of the House were,
however, insuperable. It was legislation for “the lower
orders,” and concerned “respectable folk” not at all. The
bill was read a third time without opposition, slipped
through the Lords unopposed, and received the Royal
assent, 12th August, 1867, as 30 and 31 <span class="smcap">Victoriæ</span>, Cap.
84&mdash;<cite>An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating
to Vaccination</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>As another example of the advocacy with which this
bill was commended to the House of Commons, I take
the following from the close of the speech of Lord
Robert Montagu, when introducing it to committee,
14th June, 1867. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smallpox differs from other epidemics in this, that it is one of
the worst, but is absolutely preventible. In other diseases all that
can be done by the removal of predisposing conditions is to mitigate
their virulence; but Smallpox may be altogether prevented.
If, then, one who raises his hand against another and kills him is
guilty of murder, of what shall he be guilty who, by voice or vote
in this House, endeavours to prevent the passing of a measure
which will make it absolutely certain that Smallpox shall no longer
kill 7,000 a-year in this country!</p></div>

<p>This absurd adjuration was too much for Mr. Henley,
who observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The somewhat formidable close of the noble Lord’s speech made
it difficult to know whether I ought not to walk out of the House
and leave the responsibility of the measure to others. He said
those who objected to the bill would be guilty of the deaths of those
who died of Smallpox.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Robert Montagu</span>&mdash;I said that Smallpox was so far preventible
that those who stopped the adoption of Vaccination would
be guilty of the deaths of 7,000 children a-year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henley</span>&mdash;I understood the noble Lord to say that they
would incur that guilt if they objected to the machinery of the bill.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Robert Montagu</span>&mdash;No; not to its machinery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henley</span>&mdash;Then I do not know precisely what the noble
Lord does mean.</p></div>

<p>In short, the bill was neither honestly advocated or
seriously considered. On the one hand, members of
Parliament were prejudiced, ignorant and credulous, and
careless as to legislation that did not affect their families
or those of their influential constituents. On the other
hand there was a knot of medical officials eager for
power and the aggrandisement of their profession, who
did not disdain to practise upon the prejudice, the ignorance,
and the credulity of Parliament. The result was
an insufferable outrage upon the rights of every nonconformist&mdash;an
outrage which, if perpetrated on the theological
instead of the scientific conscience, would have
roused Englishmen to fever heat.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">THE GATHERING MOVEMENT&mdash;1867-70.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Section 31 of the Act of 1867 implied the doom of
Vaccination. It was bad enough to fine a parent for
refusing to vaccinate his child; it was, however, a circumscribed
annoyance; but to make of refusal a continuous
offence until a child attained the age of fourteen
was to set up a cause of quarrel that had to be fought
out. Slavery in the United States is abolished, but
slavery might have endured to this day had the
Southerners been more forbearing; but, in the arrogance
of their power, they imposed on the Union the
Fugitive Slave Law, compelling the people of the North
to surrender runaway negroes. This triumph of the
slaveholders determined the fate of slavery. In like
manner the arrogance of the vaccinators overcame their
prudence. Resolved to subdue resistance to their rite,
they drove resistance to extremity, and set up an irreducible
insurrection. As a medical prescription accepted
at discretion, vaccination might have survived unquestioned
and paid for; but its transition into an aggressive
statute removed it from the safe realm of professional
mystery into the jurisdiction of common sense, common
observation, and every man’s business.</p>

<p>Sec. 31, Act ’67, was quickly turned to account by
the medical officials who had devised and imposed it
upon the indifference of Parliament. They had, of
course, to operate through local poor-law authorities&mdash;a
painful necessity; but guardians were occasionally as
fanatical as themselves, and exasperated, too, that their
petty authority should be set at naught, and especially
by parents in humble life. Consequently, here and there
over the country continued prosecutions for refusing to
vaccinate were initiated, stirring up strife, begetting
sympathy with the prosecuted, and gradually converting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
vaccination into a living political question. Whatever
may be thought of Sec. 31, Act ’67, all will allow that
it drew a line and established irritation and conflict.
Opposition to vaccination had hitherto to contend with
nothing so deadly as apathy, but from that drawback it
was now delivered. On the other hand, in many parishes,
Sec. 31, Act ’67 was allowed to make no difference.
Those who disliked vaccination were warned, or prosecuted
once, and then let alone; but this leniency served
to accentuate the severity practised elsewhere, and to
render the law still more odious by reason of the flagrant
inequality of its administration.</p>

<p>The scientific opposition to vaccination, initiated by
Mr. John Gibbs in 1855, had for some years few accessions,
and it required faith in truth in full measure to
persist in its advocacy. The Jennerian tradition was so
rooted in the public mind that to question it savoured of
paradox or profanity. There were occasional manifestations
of scepticism when smallpox attacked the vaccinated,
but doubt was crushed down as impious and
dangerous to established confidence. Mr. Herbert Spencer,
for example, in <cite>Social Statics,</cite> published in 1851, observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The measures enjoined by the Vaccination Act of 1840 were to
have exterminated Smallpox; yet the reports of the Registrar-General
show that deaths from Smallpox have been increasing.</p></div>

<p>To such matter-of-fact criticism, any answer must
have taken form in the style of the bewildered divine,
who exclaimed, “Dear brethren, what theology can we
enjoy if such objections be entertained!”</p>

<p>Dr. Charles T. Pearce was one of the first to unite
with Mr. Gibbs in his labours. As editor of a medical
journal, he happened to receive an article from Mr.
Gibbs which set him thinking, and as the result of his
inquiries, he came out an enthusiastic anti-vaccinator.
He made the question of vaccination completely his own,
and lectured on the subject throughout the country,
eager and ready for combat. In Northampton, in 1860,
he held his first public debate, and under his influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
the town became a centre of resistance to the compulsory
law, so that Mr. Charles Gilpin, M.P. for the borough,
addressing his constituents in 1870, thus expressed himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have always thought that when we try to enforce one of the
ever-changing opinions of medical men, we touch upon the liberty
of the subject and the rights of human nature. I find that a
number of parents are fined because they are convinced that
Vaccination is useless and injurious. I ask, What is the character
of those parents? Are they idle? Are they dissolute? Are they
drunken? Are they careless of the welfare of their children? The
answer is emphatically, No! They are thoughtful, they are industrious,
they are sober. They are men who look into the reasons
of things, and who decline to be driven into any course of conduct
which they do not rationally approve. When I was in business in
the City of London I had my goods seized almost every year for
Church rates. I objected to the law, and with a free heart and a firm
voice, I said I will endure the penalty. I would not obey a law
which I knew to be wrong. Therefore it is that I sympathise with
those who are persuaded that Vaccination is wrong; and for their
encouragement and consolation let me say, that as compulsory
Church rates were abolished because of the stedfast testimony
borne against them by Nonconformists, so will compulsion as applied
to Vaccination, if resistance is consistently and seriously
maintained. As the Society of Friends has demonstrated, no law
can survive under the persistent protest of conscience.</p></div>

<p>Tenacity was the distinction of Dr. Pearce. Undismayed
by whatever odds, he maintained his position
with deliberation and patience, and by neither historical,
statistical, or physiological data was it possible to circumvent
him. When he entered into the controversy
in 1856, fool and fanatic was the summary designation
of whoever ventured to dispute the salvation wrought
by vaccination; but, living until 1883, he witnessed
such epithets received with amusement as denoting
the ill-humour and impotence of those who employed
them.</p>

<p>An energetic advocate of the good cause appeared in
Dr. W. J. Collins, who, after twenty years of service in
London as public vaccinator, felt compelled to renounce
the practice as useless and injurious. He stated his conviction
frankly and forcibly before the St. Pancras Sanitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
Committee in 1863,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and in an essay, vigorous with
mother-wit, published in 1867,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> he communicated much
useful and unpleasant information to the credulous and
deceived public. To contend with a judgment thus
instructed and qualified was useless; and those who were
affected by the exposure took care to avoid it. Nor considering
the danger to the craft from discussion, was the
policy injudicious. Truth has many adversaries, but
none so hard to overcome as the non-resistant silence of
timorous self-interest.</p>

<p>A leader and organiser of the opposition was wanted,
and he appeared in Richard Butler Gibbs, cousin of John
Gibbs, who, as we have seen, framed the first systematic
indictment of vaccination in 1855. Mr. Gibbs, of Irish
parentage, was born in London in 1822, and in the course
of a commercial career became agent at Pease’s West
Collieries for Joseph Pease of Darlington, the first Quaker
M.P. It was in 1863, when a member of the Bishop
Auckland board of guardians, that he first moved publicly
against vaccination, and then less against the practice
itself than against its prescription by the authority at
that time vested in the Privy Council. He cautioned his
colleagues that they were likely to become (as they since
have) the tools of a central medical clique. Subsequently
finding himself comparatively free from business, he
devoted himself to the cause with which his name
has been identified. Gathering together the scattered
elements of resistance, he formed in 1866 the Anti-Compulsory
Vaccination League, and travelled over the
country, lecturing and holding public meetings. The
enactment of repeated penalties for non-vaccination,
strenuously resisted by Mr. Gibbs, established “a raw,”
and conferred on the League a grievance and purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
everywhere recognised as indisputable by the people.
Sec. 31, Act ’67 was in a popular sense the making of the
agitation against vaccination; and it has been maintained
(in a sense fortunately) until even the withdrawal of the
aggravation cannot save vaccination itself from ultimate
rejection. What at the moment we like least, often in
the end serves us best.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Pitman of Manchester entered actively into
the movement. He had observed the ill effects of vaccination
upon one of his own children, and in connection
with Mr. R. B. Gibbs organised public meetings in
Manchester and other places. In 1869 he tried how far
a penny journal would succeed, and started <cite>The Anti-Vaccinator</cite>
which ran for eighteen weeks. As editor of <cite>The
Co-operator</cite>, which he conducted for ten years, he gave
prominence to vaccination news, and in 1870 adjoined
<cite>Anti-Vaccinator</cite> to the title, which was continued until
<cite>The Co-operative News</cite> was established in 1871, when he
maintained the publication as <cite>The Anti-Vaccinator</cite> until
the close of the year. In 1876 Mr. Pitman bore testimony
to his convictions by going to the Knutsford
House of Correction rather than pay the fine and costs
imposed upon him for refusing to have his daughter,
Violet, vaccinated, and in <cite>Prison Thoughts</cite> conveyed to
others the lesson of his experience. Mr. Pitman has
been remarkably successful in impressing public men
with his opinions. Courteous and persistent, he has won
consideration where rougher speech might not have prevailed.</p>

<p>Professor F. W. Newman was led to a knowledge of
the dangers of vaccination by Mr. Henry Pitman; and
those who have been observant of his career in later
years know with what courage and consistency he has
asserted his convictions. Having asked the Professor
how he became concerned in the opposition to vaccination,
he favoured me thus&mdash;</p>

<p>“The outline of my mental history in this direction is
as follows. Circumstances had led me to respect Mr.
Henry Pitman as a competent and truthful witness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
fact. On a certain occasion he spoke publicly on the
miserable state to which he had seen a poor lad, Ira Connell
of Southport, reduced by vaccination. Ira’s parents, and
his brothers and sisters, were all hale: his mother attested
that previous to vaccination so was Ira. But <em>after</em> vaccination,
Ira had never recovered its dreadful effects,
three of his four limbs being crippled.</p>

<p>“Some years later, I myself saw Ira Connell at Southport.
I think his age was then 25, but am not sure.
He had only one leg sound, and hardly one arm. I will
not undertake to describe his state exactly, but it was
<em>very pitiable</em>. I am happy to add that in nine or ten
years more he has gradually recovered, so as at least not
to be visibly crippled.</p>

<p>“Previously I had <em>refused to read</em> anti-vaccination
tracts, <em>having too much already to read</em>. I had never
<em>known</em> or <em>heard</em> in my own circles of mischief from
vaccination, and when some German ladies spoke of its
‘<em>horrors</em>’ I thought them absurd and fanatical; but now
that Henry Pitman publicly attested <em>a fact</em>, this woke
me up to the duty of further inquiry.</p>

<p>“I at once remembered that in my early youth or
boyhood I had been staggered by reading in a medical
journal that experience made it impossible to sustain
Jenner’s doctrine that vaccination was a certain preventive
of smallpox; but the writer nevertheless urged that
it was valuable for making smallpox <em>milder</em> if it did
follow. This struck me as an ugly shifting of the basis,
and far from plausible. One school-and-college fellow of
mine, <em>after vaccination</em>, had smallpox that marked him;
but nothing further led me to pursue the argument.</p>

<p>“I now at once saw that <em>compulsory</em> vaccination was
an infamy, since Parliament could not secure any one
from Ira Connell’s fate: and I was indignant on learning
that doctors pooh-poohed such miseries, as endured ‘<em>for
the general good</em>,’ a theory which justifies any amount
of tyranny under the influence of superstition; and I
presently remembered that in Roman pestilences <em>sacrifices</em>
were believed efficacious, and the arguments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
priests and senators were quite as good as those of our
physicians.</p>

<p>“I find that in 1869 I had a sharp debate with a clever
young student of Medicine, who poured out the doctrines
of the Faculty, which he had been getting up. My
respect for the whole Faculty has rapidly got less and
less; it had long been declining. I need not obtrude on
you the depth to which it has now sunk, excepting
always a noble few, who are what Heretics were to the
Mediæval Church.</p>

<p>“Next I saw that no Parliament or King has, or can
have, any right (<em>on medical theory</em>) to stick a poisoned
lancet into a <em>healthy</em> person; and that to fancy that
Human Health can be improved by altering the natural
blood of Health is <em>an imbecile contemptible fancy</em>.
Moreover, that unless Vaccination is believed to <em>remove
the causes</em> of smallpox, those causes would entail disease
in other ways, and perhaps worse, by suppressing <em>the
natural eruption</em>, which eruption alone is called ‘Smallpox.’
My mind was thus decided.</p>

<p>“I did not learn till some years later (<em>what alone
concerns Parliament</em>) that the more active is smallpox,
the less is the Total Mortality of any year; and
conversely, the less active the smallpox, the greater is
the Total Mortality. This is the only form of statistics
worth attending to. All the rest is dust thrown in our
eyes.</p>

<p>“Statistics not founded on a scientific principle are the
commonest <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nidus</i> of fallacy; but if <em>any</em> statistics are to
be listened to, those of Total Mortality are the least open
to suspicion. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> evidence is, that instead
of Vaccination saving yearly 80,000 lives (Sir Lyon
Playfair’s monstrous assertion) Vaccination does only
harm; but that Smallpox <em>saves</em> every year many lives
(some hundreds or thousands) by a natural eruption,
under the morbid circumstances <em>desirable</em>.”</p>

<p>The Countess de Noailles contributed most efficient
assistance toward opening the public mind and letting
in light. In a communication her ladyship says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ask me how it was that my name came to be
connected with the present anti-vaccination movement.</p>

<p>“It was in this way. On my return to England in
1865, Mrs. Cowper-Temple, now Lady Mount Temple,
asked me to visit the office of the Ladies’ Sanitary
Association, which I had joined her in starting four years
before. I had wished the Association to be called the
Ladies’ Association for the Protection of the Health of
the Children of the Poor; but that was thought too long
a name, and was changed; and I mention it only to
explain what my idea was in helping to form the Society.
Well, on visiting the office of the Association, I saw
among the sanitary tracts one with the title, <em>When were
you vaccinated?</em> On reading the words, it struck me
suddenly that vaccination was all wrong, but as I knew
nothing whatever about it, and had heard naught but
praise of the practice, I told the excellent secretary of
the Association my misgivings on the subject, and she
set to work to find out all that was known or thought
on the question. Miss Griffiths soon learnt that three
relatives&mdash;John, Richard, and George Gibbs&mdash;had for
twenty years been writing and working against vaccination,
besides Dr. Collins and others. Seeing that I was
not alone in my conviction, I resolved to elicit more
opinion on the subject by giving a prize for the best
essay on the same, setting forth the supposed benefits,
dangers, etc. Miss Griffiths went heart and soul into
the question, and with the help of Dr. Druitt, I think,
she had judges named and the prize of £100 offered.
The judges were Mr. Marson, Dr. Richardson, and Dr.
Francis Webb&mdash;all in favour of vaccination. The great
length of the essay by Dr. Ballard gave it a claim for the
prize, and the tremendous because <em>unavoidable</em> admissions
as to the dreadful dangers of vaccination contained
in this Prize Essay, have caused the doctors to try to
suppress it&mdash;so at least I have heard.</p>

<p>“Miss Griffiths sent me in November, 1866, the <cite>Lancet</cite>,
containing a horrible account of the poisoning of thirty-six
children in Morbihan, Brittany, by public vaccination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>

<p>“My forebodings being thus so terribly confirmed, I
tried to interest all the doctors who advised the Ladies’
Sanitary Association in the new difficulties in the way
of this dreadful practice; but the only one who lent an
ear to the sad tale was Dr. Garth Wilkinson, who began
mildly, but afterwards waxed valiant in fight. May he
and the little band which his genius has helped to bring
into the field ‘soon put to flight the armies of the aliens.’</p>

<p>“In 1867 a letter from the Rev. W. Hume-Rothery
against compulsory vaccination struck me, and he set to
work at the question in the co-operative newspapers;
and latterly in the <cite>Reporter</cite>, in which he has been ably
helped by Mrs. Hume-Rothery, the daughter of the late
Mr. Joseph Hume, M.P. The strength given to the bad
law by Lord Robert Montagu’s Act in 1867 roused its
enemies at the same time; and, feeling that my task was
done, I left the contest to abler hands.</p>

<p>“I thus found that the Association I had inaugurated
in order ‘<em>to protect the health of poor children</em>,’ was
being made into an instrument to bind them through
their mothers’ ignorance to the most wholesale plan for
their degeneration, if not destruction, ever invented by
the mind of man. It was in vain that I tried to get the
ladies of the Sanitary Association to think over the
matter. I was always met by the remark that it was <em>a
medical question</em> and one which <em>doctors alone could
decide</em>; and all I could obtain of them was to allow me
to buy up the offending tract and to remain neutral in
the question. When I left the Association a few years
after, the tract was circulated again.</p>

<p>“The compulsory law seems to me well described in
these words of Carlyle:&mdash;‘To decree <em>injustice</em> by a <em>law</em>&mdash;inspired
prophets have long since seen, what every
clear soul may still see, that of all Anarchies and Devil-worships
there is none like this; that this is the “throne
of iniquity” set up in the name of the Highest, the
human apotheosis of Anarchy itself.’”</p>

<p>Dr. Ballard’s essay was of itself a notable achievement.
Written in defence of vaccination, the difficulties, dangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
and futility of the practice were so largely revealed, that
any thoughtful reader was compelled to inquire, Where
shall we find compensation for all this trouble, these
risks, these sufferings? Dr. Ballard’s essay soon ran out
of print, and the author was judiciously enlisted in the
medical service of the Local Government Board.</p>

<p>In Dr. Garth Wilkinson the movement obtained the
assistance not only of an able physician, but of one whom
Emerson has described as “a philosophic critic, with a
coequal vigour of understanding and imagination comparable
only to Lord Bacon’s;” and “with a rhetoric like
the armoury of the invincible knights of old.” Having
asked Dr. Wilkinson how he came over to the side we
identify with sound science and sound sense, he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>“The early History of my Opposition to Vaccination
is, briefly, this&mdash;I had not considered Vaccination a
question; but practised it when required. About 1865
the Countess de Noailles assailed my conscience on the
subject, and her earnestness forced me to study it. She
was backed by the late Mrs. Gibbs, then Miss Griffiths.
Through Miss Griffiths I sent the following message to
Madame de Noailles&mdash;‘Tell her Ladyship that the question
is comparatively unimportant. Vaccination is an
infinitesimal affair; its reform will come in with greater
reforms.’ I also wrote to Madame that the only short
way of getting rid of the Medical vested interest was by
paying half a million or a million of money down to the
Profession, and buying the slaves, the people, out, as the
West Indian Blacks were bought out.</p>

<p>“After-studies extending over eighteen years have
convinced me that I was wrong in my estimate of the
smallness of the Vaccination question compared with
other Evils. As forced upon every British Cradle, I see
it as a Monster instead of a Poisonous Midge; a Devourer
of Nations. As a Destroyer of the Honesty and Humanity
of Medicine, which is through it a deeply-degraded Profession.
As a Tyrant which is the Parent of a brood of
Tyrants, and through Pasteur and his like a Universal
Pollution Master. As a Ghoul which sits upon Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
and enforces Contamination by Law, and prepares
the way for endless violations of personal liberty and
sound sense at the bidding of cruel experts. Not denying
other forms of Social Wickedness, I now, after careful
study, regard Vaccination as one of the greatest and
deepest forms, abolishing the last hope and resort of
races, the new-born soundness of the Human Body.”</p>

<p>The agitation against compulsory vaccination prospered
under the leadership of Mr. Gibbs. He sought help on
all sides, and harmonised its various elements to the
common purpose of the League. In his various labours
he derived efficient assistance from his brother, Mr. G. S.
Gibbs of Darlington, who displayed remarkable ability
in the interpretation of vital statistics and in the exposure
of their misapplications. Mr. Gibbs established branches
of the League wherever there were adversaries of the
practice, and was especially successful in the north of
England. The relentless application of Sec. 31, Act ’67,
in certain parts of the country did much to rouse public
attention and sympathy. Parents were repeatedly fined
for persistent refusal to have children vaccinated, and
in default of payment had their property seized, or were
committed to prison, sometimes with hard labour. Occasionally
sentences were accompanied with gross insolence
from the bench. For example, Mr. Bowman having
pleaded at Newcastle his conscientious conviction that
vaccination might prove injurious to his child, whilst it
could never save him from smallpox, was compared to a
thief by the magistrate, who said, “I once knew a man
who had conscientious scruples against working so long
as he could live by stealing; and I do not think conscience
of that sort is entitled to respect.” Law on such
terms naturally invites execration, and many who might
hold by vaccination are thereby turned against it.</p>

<p>By some it was thought questionable whether Sec. 31,
Act ’67, did afford warrant for repeated prosecutions.
Mr. John Candlish, M.P. for Sunderland, who sat on the
Committee of 1866 which dealt with the Bill which
became law in 1867, maintained “that it was not intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
that penalties should be repeated, but that one penalty
should be a discharge from any obligation to submit a
child to vaccination.” It is needless to say, an Act of
Parliament is not to be interpreted by the intentions of
its framers, but by its words. Moreover, if intentions
are brought into question, it would be fair to set intentions
against intentions. Several who were concerned
in promoting the Act of ’67 had intentions more arbitrary
than were conveyed in Sec. 31.</p>

<p>The question, was raised by the Rev. H. J. Allen,
Primitive Methodist. He had been <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'repeatedy before'">repeatedly before</ins> the
bench at St. Neots, and was committed to prison for
fourteen days, but, having paid the fine, £5, was liberated.
In less than a month, he was summoned again, and fined
£1 for each of his children, including costs. An appeal
was made to the Court of Queen’s Bench in 1870, and
judgment confirmed the severer interpretation of Sec.
31, Act ’67. Lord Chief Justice Cockburn held that
a parent having been fined under the Act for disobeying
an order to have his child vaccinated, may be proceeded
against from time to time as long as the child remains
unvaccinated. He declined to discuss whether vaccination
was good or bad; the Legislature had treated it as
a matter of great importance, and had passed Acts to
ensure attention to it; that being so, he could not doubt
that the intention of the Legislature was not merely to
impose a penalty upon a person, once and for all, for
having omitted to do that which the public health and
safety required; but to enforce obedience to the requisitions
of the law. He thought, therefore, the order to
vaccinate might be renewed, and the penalties might be
repeated until the order was obeyed. Mr. Justice Mellor
and Mr. Justice Hannen concurred. The judgment in
this case, known as Allen <em>v.</em> Worthy, has been repeatedly
questioned and always reaffirmed.</p>

<p>Immediately after Mr. Candlish introduced a Bill to
the House of Commons to amend the law, repeating his
conviction that the construction put upon the Act of ’67
was never intended by Parliament, and that it was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
mere verbal accident that penalties were made continuous.
The Bill was introduced too late in the session (6th July,
1870) to be carried, but it led to discussion and a promise
from Government that the question would be remitted
to a Committee next year, 1871.</p>

<span class="chap-hdr">HOUSE OF COMMONS COMMITTEE, 1871.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">On 13th February, 1871, Mr. W. E. Forster moved that
a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the
operation of the Vaccination Act of 1867, and to report
whether such Act should be amended. Mr. Forster’s
remarks on the occasion are noteworthy, as manifesting
the prevalent prejudice. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I make the motion in compliance with a promise made to the
Member for Sunderland last session, who had brought in a Bill to
relax the punishment for refusal to permit Vaccination. I do not
imagine that Mr. Candlish, more than any other member of the
House, has the slightest doubt of the utility and necessity of Vaccination,
and that it is necessary not only to encourage the practice,
but to make it compulsory. Opposition to Vaccination is not heard
in the House of Commons; but it is found, I am sorry to say,
among certain persons in the country, who have carried their
resistance to an extent that has been injurious to health and
destructive to life. [Evolution this from Forster’s fancy.] These
people must have forgotten the state of the country before Vaccination
was introduced.</p></div>

<p>Then followed the usual fabulous matter of rote&mdash;the
awful mortality prior to vaccination, the reduction of
that mortality by vaccination, the extraordinary immunity
enjoyed by the vaccinated and revaccinated, and
so forth&mdash;uttered and accepted as indisputable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Government do not entertain any doubt of the efficacy
and advantages of Vaccination, nor of the necessity of enforcing it.
They have to contend with opposition&mdash;the opposition of ignorance,
and also, I am sorry to say, with the opposition arising from
interested motives [What possibly could they be?] preying upon that
ignorance; and lastly, with the great neglect arising from apathy.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Charles Adderley opposed the appointment of the
Committee. Accepting Mr. Forster’s statement as valid,
he demanded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What is there to inquire about? Inquiry that is superfluous
may be mischievous. Nothing can be more dangerous than to
affect doubtfulness concerning legislation as to which there is not
only no doubt, but a call for more rigorous administration.</p></div>

<p>Apparently the Government were of the same mind as
Sir Charles, and the Committee was conceded in fulfilment
of an inadvertent pledge. Mr. Forster assured the
House&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Government do not propose this Committee with the slightest
doubt about the principle of Vaccination, or the necessity of Compulsory
Vaccination; and I need not say we have no intention of
relaxing the operation of the law during the deliberations of the
Committee.</p></div>

<p>The Committee was nominated as follows on 16th
February&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">

Mr. <span class="smcap">P. A. Taylor</span>, Leicester.<br />
</p>

<p>The first witness examined was Mr. Candlish, himself
a member of the Committee and promoter of the inquiry.
Whilst professing a limited faith in vaccination, and
willing to exercise a degree of pressure sufficient to overcome
mere apathy, Mr. Candlish was strongly opposed
to the compulsion of parents who seriously objected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
vaccination, and especially to their persecution by repeated
penalties and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Dr. W. J. Collins, the next witness, opened the entire
question of vaccination, and by a variety of experience
showed that the vaccine disease neither superseded nor
mitigated smallpox, whilst it was frequently a severe
ailment and the means of exciting and conveying other
diseases.</p>

<p>Dr. C. T. Pearce followed suit. The purpose of the
Committee (limited to the consideration of the compulsory
law) was apparently forgotten, and Dr. Pearce
delivered a comprehensive discourse, in which the history,
claims, failure, fallacies, and disasters of vaccination were
freely displayed; and in the cross-examination which
followed made good the positions he had assumed.</p>

<p>Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, Bart., formerly M.P. for
South Hants, disputed the common notions of infection
as confused with contagion, and pointed out that it was
absurd to draw comparisons between the vaccinated and
unvaccinated unless their pecuniary status were at the
same time defined: cases of smallpox in Belgravia were
not to be likened to cases in Clerkenwell. Smallpox was
not mitigated by vaccination: he had two relatives
vaccinated by Jenner himself who subsequently had
confluent smallpox so severely that “their own father did
not know them.” Nor if smallpox had diminished was
there any reason to ascribe it to vaccination: Jenner’s
cowpox had ceased out of the land, and the cause of its
cessation might equally apply to smallpox.</p>

<p>Dr. Garth Wilkinson gave evidence with the characteristic
wisdom of the physician of genius who sees
with his own eyes. He showed how, endowed and
lucrative, the futility and mischief of vaccination were
concealed or denied, and how, considered all sufficient
against smallpox, the causes of the disease were overlooked,
and the introduction of improved methods of
treatment were unattempted or discouraged.</p>

<p>Mr. George S. Gibbs contested the right of the State
to inflict vaccination, or to interfere between parent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
child. Having a faculty for statistics, he had applied
himself to the records of smallpox before and since the
practice of vaccination, at home and abroad, and showed
that smallpox was the same at present as in the past,
neither more mortal nor less mortal, while there was
reason to believe that vaccination was a breeder of
smallpox as well as a source and excitant of other
maladies.</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Emery related in vigorous English how an
infant of his had been vaccinated from a healthy-looking
child on 31st May, 1869; how erysipelas followed; how
it gradually got worse; how “the little fellow had no
rest night nor day from 9th June to 4th July, when
death put an end to his sufferings.” Then he told the
difficulty he had to obtain a true certificate of death from
the vaccinator; how he forced an inquest; how a verdict
was returned, “Died from erysipelas caused by vaccination”;
and how its terms were subsequently altered by
Coroner Lankester and registered as altered at Somerset
House. Up to the time of this fatality, Mr. Emery had
been an unsuspicious believer in vaccination; but his
sorrow led him to acquaintance with numerous cases like
his own, screened from public recognition, any artifice
being accounted laudable which seemed necessary to
preserve vaccination from reproach.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Covington, secretary of the Northampton Anti-Vaccination
League, described injuries from vaccination
in his family and among his acquaintance; the distrust
and dislike of the practice in Northampton with widespread
resistance to the compulsory law.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. Kemp brought her baby, and told how it had
been vaccinated without examination, although there
was a sore on the side of its head. As the vaccination
began to take, the child’s face and ears broke out, until
through the mass of eruption “you could only see its
little eyes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Baker, barrister, had been engaged in the
Board of Health from 1849 to 1854, and officially connected
with several sanitary inquiries. In his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
what were called epidemics were fevers with a common
origin, against which cleanliness was the efficient prophylactic,
and to which his friend, Dr. Southwood Smith,
held smallpox was equally amenable. As a shareholder
in the Metropolitan Association for the Improvement
of the Dwellings of the Industrial Classes, he knew
that residents in wholesome houses, even in insanitary
neighbourhoods, enjoyed remarkable exemption from
epidemic maladies.</p>

<p>Mr. W. J. Addison testified that his perfectly healthy
child had had syphilis invaccinated, and had died in
consequence after horrible suffering. The facts of the
case were beyond question. One hospital doctor had the
temerity to ask the mother, “Whether is it not better for
one in a thousand to die like this than have smallpox
raging about our towns.” “Possibly,” replied the poor
woman, “but it is strange that my child should be the
thousandth.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Wm. Hume-Rothery said his attention was
first drawn to vaccination by the operation on his own
child, his wife observing instinctively, “This is an
unnatural and wrong thing.” Investigation confirmed
his wife’s judgment, and he became an open opponent of
the practice, writing and lecturing against it. His
acquaintance with the people in Lancashire had led him
to the conviction that the majority disliked and distrusted
vaccination: they were coerced to its observance, and
evaded it when possible. He himself was opposed to
vaccination because there was nothing in nature, human
nature, or revelation to justify it. This assertion of
principle over and above practice led to considerable discussion
as to divine law, providence, and the nature of
things, and the right of conscience to withstand corporate
dictation.</p>

<p>Mr. R. B. Gibbs, secretary of the Anti-Compulsory
Vaccination League, referred to the origin of vaccination,
as attested by Jenner, in the production of cowpox from
the contagion of horsegrease, and subsequently to the
use of horsepox, by which equination was substituted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
vaccination; the diverse virus thus derived from Jenner
continuing in official arm-to-arm currency to the present
day. What vaccination was had never been determined;
and consequently there had been no proper basis for
legislation. Nor had legislation been preceded by impartial
and adequate inquiry: it had been promoted by
certain medical men, supported by the press, and especially
by <cite>The Times</cite>, the editors of which jealously suppressed
all communications which impugned the efficacy of the
rite. Interrogated as to the amendment of the law, Mr.
Gibbs said he had no amendment to propose: the State
should withdraw all assistance from the practice, and
leave its use or disuse to individual discretion.</p>

<p>At this point the evidence of the anti-vaccinists was
cut short. They had much more to produce, but enough
had been heard. The Committee had forgotten its purpose,
which was not to discuss vaccination, but, accepting
the rite as unquestionable, to consider whether the law
which enforced it was capable of amendment. Still, the
mischief being done, it was thought advisable to counteract
it; and forthwith contrary testimony was laid on.
Various officials who for years had made the promotion
of vaccination their business were summoned to the
rescue, along with certain fashionable physicians, whose
assurance, it was calculated, would overcome any distrust
that might be excited in the public mind.</p>

<p>The first of the officials was Mr. John Simon, a review
of whose <cite>Papers on Vaccination</cite> forms <a href="#CHAPTER_aXL">Chapter XL.</a> of
the present volume. Evidence from Mr. Simon relative
to vaccination was of much the same order as that of a
Virginian of former days on slavery, or a thriving London
publican on the liquor traffic. Mr. Simon answered to
the demand upon him: he was thorough: there was
nothing like leather&mdash;nothing! Smallpox was among
the most contagious and most fatal of pestilences, and
“for an overwhelming majority of persons, well vaccinated
in infancy, vaccination was a security for life against
even an attack of smallpox.” The unvaccinated died at
the rate of 35½ per cent.; the vaccinated in general at 7<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
per cent.; and “the properly vaccinated” at from 1 to ½
per cent.&mdash;the fact being concealed that in times when
all were unvaccinated, the smallpox death-rate ranged
from 10 to 18 per cent., the same overhead death-rate of
vaccinated and unvaccinated at this day. There had
never been, he believed, a case of death from the direct
effect of “properly performed vaccination”&mdash;the qualification,
it will be observed, referring all cases of death to
something other than the correct rite. He admitted
there was not the least doubt that syphilis had been
invaccinated on the Continent, but either from carelessness
or culpable intention. Sanitation, he said, had
little or no influence on smallpox: vaccination was the
only protective&mdash;which variety of vaccination being
judiciously left undefined. Smallpox did not displace
other fevers during its prevalence, as alleged by Dr.
Pearce. Holding that 97 per cent. of Londoners were
vaccinated, he did not see that the epidemic then raging,
the severest of the century, disproved the security asserted
for vaccination.</p>

<p>As we read Simon’s evidence, we realise afresh the
possibilities of audacity operating on credulity: there is
nothing that men, otherwise sane, may not believe when
their disposition is set toward belief. This Committee
sat in London amid a population, almost universally
vaccinated, suffering from smallpox as they never had
suffered within living memory; and yet in presence of
such a demonstration of the impotence of the vaccine
ordinance, they listened to the soothsayer with abject
acquiescence! Strange as are the records of witchcraft,
there is nothing in them more marvellous than this 1871
Committee of select men from the House of Commons
taking for true what under their own eyes was visible as
untrue&mdash;deceived and consenting to be deceived.</p>

<p>As for those who disputed the efficacy of vaccination,
and justified their disbelief by smallpox among the
vaccinated, Simon’s contempt was unqualified&mdash;contempt
being essential to the success of the part enacted. “Some
of them were ignorant,” he said, “and others dishonest.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
They were a “league of persons interested in interrupting
the fulfilment of the law, and very actively engaged in
disseminating falsehoods against vaccination”&mdash;falsehoods
in its favour actively disseminated by Simon and
his trade-union being disinterested and praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Dr. R. Hall Bakewell, vaccinator-general for Trinidad,
was somehow produced by mistake, his evidence being
in several respects the reverse of what was wanted. He
thought vaccination good, but that “it should be done in
a more careful manner.” It ought not to be compulsory,
but left to the good sense of the people. Having been
proved to cause death, “it was unjust to oblige a parent
to submit his child to an operation attended with such
risk, however rare.” Referring to his experience in
Trinidad, he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3557.&mdash;I have seen Vaccination produce inflammation of the arm
and general fever lasting for several days. Such illness was often
alleged as an excuse by mothers for not bringing their children for
inspection on the 8th day. At first I was inclined to regard the
assertion as a mere excuse, but on visiting the homes I found the
children were really ill, and that it was not safe to bring them for
inspection.</p>

<p>3563.&mdash;There is a strong opinion prevalent in Trinidad, and in
the West Indies generally, that Leprosy has been introduced to
the system by Vaccination. I found that medical men when they
had occasion to vaccinate their own children, or those of patients
in whom they were specially interested, applied to me for English
lymph in order to avoid the invaccination of Leprosy, notwithstanding
there was an equal, and probably a greater, chance of the
English lymph being contaminated with Syphilis. I had several
cases of Leprosy in which Vaccination seemed the only means of
accounting for the disease.</p></div>

<p>As a consequence of this prevalent opinion, vaccination
was much disliked in Trinidad, and, although by law
compulsory, was indifferently enforced, so that at least
half the population escaped unvaccinated.</p>

<p>Interrogated concerning smallpox in Trinidad, Dr.
Bakewell said there had been no epidemic for fourteen
or fifteen years when one occurred “frightfully severe,
as are all epidemics in Trinidad, owing to the entire
neglect of sanitary precautions”; adding that “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
mortality from smallpox may be greatly diminished by
sanitary measures independently of vaccination.” The
Doctor still further ruffled the prejudices of the Committee
in asserting&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3783.&mdash;I do not believe that the general mortality of the country
is at all diminished by the absence of Smallpox. In Trinidad, for
instance, our mortality is none the less because we have neither
Smallpox, nor Whooping Cough, nor Scarlet Fever, nor Measles&mdash;the
four most prolific causes of death among young children.
Nevertheless infant mortality in Port of Spain is double that of
London. By merely cutting off one disease from the category of
diseases, you do not lessen the mortality of a country&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Precisely what Dr. Watt proved of Glasgow in 1813,
and Dr. Farr at a later date confirmed; and what the
comparison of the statistics of mortality in epidemic and
non-epidemic years everywhere illustrates.</p>

<p>With the examination of Mr. Danby Palmer Fry, head
of the legal department of the Poor Law Board, the
Committee reverted to its proper function. Questioned
as to the state of the law and the difficulties connected
with its administration, Mr. Fry showed that whilst
vaccination was nominally compulsory, any resolute
parent might disregard it. To make vaccination really
compulsory, it would be necessary to legislate for its
application by force, which legislation public opinion
would not tolerate. For himself, he thought that parental
conviction adverse to vaccination was entitled to respect,
and he therefore suggested&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3845.&mdash;That it might, perhaps, be worthy of consideration whether
a man might not be exempted from the penalty who takes an oath
or makes an affirmation that he has a conscientious objection to
the vaccination of his child. It seems to me that this would be
similar in principle to the statutes which prohibited the Ecclesiastical
Courts from issuing execution against the person of a
Quaker, though they might do so against his goods, on the express
ground that the people called Quakers were known to entertain
conscientious objections to the payment of tithes and church rates.</p></div>

<p>Sir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., a member of the Committee,
next gave evidence, and the defence of vaccination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
was resumed. So little did Sir Dominic apprehend the
purpose of the Committee that he observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3992.&mdash;I think the great question before us is whether vaccine
poison can contain within itself syphilitic poison or any other
poison.</p></div>

<p>As to the invaccination of syphilis, he was clear: it
was impossible. Vaccination induced no disease. Virus
was nothing but pure lymph, even when taken from an
impure subject. Vaccination was regarded with favour
throughout Ireland. It was enforced, but it required no
enforcement: there was no disposition to resist the law.
He disliked penalties, and would rather operate by excluding
the unvaccinated from schools, factories, and
public employments, on the ground that “they might
become a mine of disease and injure others,” namely,
to the vaccinated fortified against smallpox!</p>

<p>Smallpox had been gradually declining in Ireland
under the influence of vaccination, and the disease was
then, 28th April, 1871, practically extinct. Foolhardy
was the assertion. Even while Sir Dominic was testifying,
smallpox had reappeared: 665 died of it in 1871 and
3,248 in 1872. From 1871 to 1875 there perished 5,521
of smallpox in a land from which it was claimed vaccination
had banished the disease!</p>

<p>Mr. James Furness Marson followed Sir Dominic&mdash;a
fanatical vaccinator and promoter of compulsion. For
thirty-five years surgeon of the Highgate Smallpox
Hospital, he had there elaborated the whimsical notion
that the efficacy of vaccination was measured by the
number and character of the cicatrices; holding that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4149.&mdash;A large number of the people in this country are very
badly vaccinated, having but one cicatrix hardly perceptible, and
have Smallpox as bad as if they had never been vaccinated at all.</p></div>

<p>Confronted by Mr. Jacob Bright with the fact that
Dr. Gregory, of wide experience and admitted authority,
had expressed the contrary opinion in his work on
<cite>Eruptive Fevers</cite>, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4670.&mdash;Hence we may learn how small importance is to be
attached to the cicatrix as an evidence of the perfection or imperfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
of the vaccine process. Perfect security is compatible with a
small and scarcely distinguishable cicatrix or without a large wafery
cicatrix at all; at least none perceptible five years after the
operation&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Marson made answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Gregory was an authority; but he was a very singular man
indeed, and had never investigated the subject in the extensive
way I have.</p></div>

<p>Marson was the victim of a notion, and that a poor
one, to which whatever stood in opposition was sacrificed.
Among his assertions and admissions, the following are
characteristic and illustrative&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4151.&mdash;If all children were properly vaccinated, the mortality
from Smallpox would be less than 1 per cent. There are difficulties:
there is the opposition of mothers to having their children
well vaccinated.</p>

<p>4125.&mdash;Persons who catch Smallpox after being vaccinated do
not generally have it until 18 to 25 years afterwards.</p>

<p>4220.&mdash;Smallpox itself is a much greater protection from Smallpox
than Vaccination.</p>

<p>4136.&mdash;Certainly Smallpox has no tendency to die out: it is
precisely the same disease it was a thousand years ago, and will
be a thousand years hence.</p>

<p>4148.&mdash;We have no control over Smallpox: there is no specific.
We have no power whatever of controlling Smallpox, Scarlatina,
Measles, and other febrile eruptive affections.</p>

<p>4694.&mdash;I look upon hospitals as necessary evils. They are not
places I would recommend the sick to go to. Anybody who can
afford to keep in his house should not go to an hospital.</p>

<p>4327-28.&mdash;Dr. Jenner was wrong when he said Cowpox was
derived from Horsegrease: it was supposed so at one time, but
that is set aside now.</p>

<p>4325 and 4697.&mdash;I have two sources of vaccine lymph; one from
the inoculation of a cow with Smallpox, and the other from a cow
in the neighbourhood of Brussels which had Cowpox in the natural
way.</p>

<p>4646.&mdash;There was no epidemic of Smallpox in London from 1796
to 1825; and as the absence of Smallpox was contemporaneous
with the introduction of Vaccination, it was imagined that Vaccination
had a great deal to do with it; and it was a fair conclusion.</p>

<p>4705.&mdash;Smallpox was raging to a great extent in the east of
London before the French war broke out&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Yet it is customary to ascribe the Smallpox epidemic
of 1870-71 to the Franco-German war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>The unscrupulous ferocity which animated Marson
and his associates toward those who impugned their
practice is forcibly displayed in the following questions
and answers; premising that Simon attested of Marson
that “he was a singularly careful observer”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4174.&mdash;I suppose you are aware there is a strong feeling and a
great objection on the part of a number of people against Vaccination?</p>

<p>Yes, I know there is; but I nearly always find that it is the
father who objects and not the mother; and it makes it very
suspicious.</p>

<p>4175.&mdash;What do you mean?</p>

<p>The father would like the family as small as possible that he has
to work for. I am afraid that is at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>4176.&mdash;Do you not think that is giving credit to the father for
looking much further ahead than people in that class of life
generally do?</p>

<p>I do not think they have very far to look when they have their
daily bread to earn. When the wages come in on Saturday night,
it pretty often comes to their mind how the money is disposed of&mdash;</p></div>

<p>A libel as atrocious as absurd, and significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander Wood was brought from Edinburgh to
give evidence as to Scotland of much the same tenor as
that of Sir Dominic Corrigan concerning Ireland. Dr.
Wood’s note was clear&mdash;“I do not think,” he said, “that
a person has a right to keep an unvaccinated child any
more than to keep a mad dog.” Smallpox had been
prevalent in Scotland for some years, and had been made
use of to pass a Compulsory Vaccination Act in 1863;
but it was neither shown that prior to that Act the
Scots were unvaccinated, nor that it was the unvaccinated
who suffered from smallpox&mdash;apart from those conditions
of life which make for smallpox. In the course of nature,
smallpox abated in Scotland, and the Act had the credit
of the abatement: the vaccination of the people being so
complete that Dr. Wood testified&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4399.&mdash;There would not be an unvaccinated child in Scotland if
we had some means of overtaking the migratory population&mdash;the
railway navvies and tramps, the children born by the roadside and
under hedges.</p></div>

<p>As in Ireland, there was little or no resistance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
law; and as in Ireland, it was asserted that smallpox
had been stamped out; but as in Ireland, the assumption
was nullified by experience. In the epidemic of 1871-73,
there died of smallpox no fewer than 5034 in Vaccinated
Scotland&mdash;a contradiction unforeseen by Dr. Wood and
the Committee before whom he prophesied.</p>

<p>Sir William Jenner appeared as court physician. He
had advised Her Majesty the Queen to encourage vaccination
in the case of all the members of the Royal
Family, and Her Majesty had complied with his advice,
and the Prince of Wales too. He had had great experience
as physician to the Children’s Hospital and elsewhere,
and had never seen any serious illness or death
result from vaccination. His testimony as to the harmlessness
of the practice was unqualified, and he was
“unable to conceive of any medical practitioner of standing
disbelieving in it, or thinking it mischievous”;
adding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4521.&mdash;I should consider I was very much wanting in my duty,
and, in fact, deserving of punishment, if I neglected to have my
six children vaccinated.</p></div>

<p>He approved of the compulsory law, and wished that
revaccination was likewise compulsory. As to the statistics
of smallpox and vaccination, he disowned sufficient
acquaintance; nevertheless he did not hesitate to assert
that smallpox, as a form of zymotic disease displacing
other forms, or replaced by others, was “a theory utterly
without foundation.” Of course testimony of this order
was produced for social rather than scientific ends.</p>

<p>The like was true of Dr. Gull, now Sir William. He
also professed to have never seen any serious illness
caused by vaccination; nor did he believe that vaccination
from a diseased child would communicate disease.
As a defence against smallpox, he held that vaccination
was as protective as smallpox itself. It was the duty of
the Legislature to enforce vaccination; adding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4830.&mdash;That with our present knowledge, I should think it the
most insane thing that any human creature could think of to give
up Vaccination.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>He had advised the Government to accept no one for
service in India without revaccination. Asked by Mr.
Candlish whether he would take a child by force from
its parents and vaccinate it, he replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4854.&mdash;I certainly would; just as I would take an ignorant
child and have it educated.</p></div>

<p>Less judicious than Sir William Jenner, Dr. Gull
adventured on statistics. It having been pointed out
that though smallpox was then epidemic in London, the
death-rate was not raised thereby, he attributed the
result to vaccination. “In former times smallpox produced
an enormous increase in mortality”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4780.&mdash;I think we read of 100,000 people dying of the disease in
epidemics, and I am not sure that it was not double the number. I
hardly like to trust myself as to numbers, but when I was a professor
of medicine at Guy’s Hospital, I brought those numbers
before my class, and I was astonished at the enormous number of
deaths in a Smallpox epidemic. I remember that taking all the
deaths which had occurred in the wars of Napoleon, they were not
so many by any means as the number of lives which had been
saved by Vaccination at that time. I do not remember, at the
moment, the authority for that statement, but I remember that
that was the kind of evidence that I had to bring before the class.</p></div>

<p>Verily the class at Guy’s had romance for science, and
the Committee had similar entertainment. They were
told that except for vaccination the epidemic then prevalent
in London would result “in a perfect pestilence”;
for mortality among unvaccinated populations “had been
something terrific.” They had “the history of smallpox
in China and India, where its effects had been perfectly
depopulating.” “To neglect or discourage vaccination
in their crowded English towns would be much the same
as thrusting a fire-brand into a powder magazine.”
Before the introduction of vaccination, “France lost
year after year a quarter of a million of inhabitants
(250,000) by smallpox”; and so forth and so forth;
assertions without warrant outside the intention to excite
fear in order to obtain confidence.</p>

<p>The next witness was Dr. Charles West, for twenty
years physician to the Hospital for Children, London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
where children under two years old were not received&mdash;at
ages when the immediate effects of vaccination are
obliterated or forgotten. Vaccination, in his opinion,
prevented or mitigated smallpox. “It had, no doubt,
the effect in many cases of developing a disposition to
some forms of skin disease, especially eczema;” but on
the whole it was not injurious. In the course of his
immense experience he had only known of one child
whose death was due to erysipelas caused by vaccination.
He had no proof of the invaccination of syphilis.</p>

<p>There was nothing peculiar about Dr. West’s evidence.
It was according to professional orthodoxy, from which
it would have required more than ordinary courage to
depart. Medical men by the gross could have been put
up to deliver similar evidence; but what was it worth?
The medical mind is fixed in two directions; first, that
vaccination prevents smallpox, or mitigates it; and
second, that it induces a harmless disease; a couple of
conclusions that it seems possible to maintain in presence
of a vast array of evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>If any one chooses to assert that vaccination prevents
smallpox or mitigates it, How can he be confuted? The
prevented smallpox is hid in the unknown, likewise the
severity that has been mitigated. Again, if vaccination
be held harmless, any instance of its ill effects can be
resolved into coincidence with a sneer at the vulgar
fallacy of converting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc</i> into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter hoc</i>. Possessed
with these notions, nothing is easier than to assert with
Dr. Stevens, for example, “No man has seen more of
vaccination than I have, but I have yet to see any bad
effect from the practice.” None are so blind as those
whose business it is not to see; or as Mr. Aubrey De
Vere has it, “Prejudice, which sees what it pleases, cannot
see what is plain.” It is, I contend, plainly impossible
to inflict a disease like <em>Vaccinia</em>, in any of its
varieties, without injury to the extent of the disease;
without intensifying active or exciting latent disease;
or without the risk of conveying other inoculable disease
from the vaccinifer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>“The great question before the Committee,” said Sir
Dominic Corrigan, “is whether vaccine poison can contain
within itself syphilitic or any other poison”&mdash;the
great terror being syphilitic poison. That question
the next witness, Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, an expert in
syphilis, determined. He had been called to examine
thirteen persons, mostly young adults, engaged in a
London shop, who had been revaccinated by order of
their employer during the prevalent smallpox panic.
The vaccinifer was “a fine, full-grown, healthy child,”
yet it conveyed syphilis, beyond mistake, to 11 of the 13
vaccinated. Mr. Hutchinson allowed that the vaccinator
was not to be blamed for the disaster, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5032.&mdash;I very much doubt whether it could have been avoided
by inspection. The child looked healthy, and it had passed at the
Vaccine Station as healthy.</p></div>

<p>Having similar cases within his experience, and convinced
“that syphilis <em>can</em> be communicated in the act of
vaccination,” Mr. Hutchinson was asked by Mr. Candlish
whether he was aware that the medical profession in
general denied the possibility, he replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5060.&mdash;I am not aware that the authorities on the subject deny
it; I believe that several of them hold it very clearly; I am aware
that the general opinion of the profession is perhaps opposed to
it, but not the opinion of those who have carefully investigated the
question.</p></div>

<p>To reduce the effect of testimony so injurious to vaccination,
it was attempted to make out that the danger
was limited to virus tainted with blood; and although
Mr. Hutchinson conceded that blood <em>might</em> be the medium
of transmission, it was undecided.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5073.&mdash;It is not a subject on which I should like to infer anything;
I should like to have experiments and facts.</p></div>

<p>Subsequent experience has shown that with blood or
without blood, syphilis may be invaccinated. Still, Mr.
Hutchinson, as an advocate of vaccination, and of its
compulsory infliction, “considering it of the utmost necessity
and importance,” conceded that the risk was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
infinitesimal; but (as was remarked at the time) unless
the diffusion of syphilis were infinitesimal, there was no
ground for the assumption of an infinitesimal risk. As
Mr. Hutchinson admitted&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5089.&mdash;I believe there are cases of latent Syphilis which cannot
be detected by any medical man, unless he examines into the history
of the child as well as its appearance.</p></div>

<p>Mr. James Neighbour, vaccination officer of St. Luke’s,
Middlesex, a district of 60,000 inhabitants, chiefly poor,
described the operation of the Vaccination Acts. He met
with little resistance to the law; the births were vaccinated
up to the registration point, but he had no check
on those who might neglect or evade registration, or
leave or settle in St. Luke’s.</p>

<p>Dr. E. C. Seaton, as select representative of the official
vaccine ring, was reserved for the consummation of the
inquiry. To review his evidence, delivered with much
elaboration, would be to repeat much of our story.
Vaccination was afresh set forth as “a perfectly safe and
efficient prophylactic against smallpox, which might be
as reasonably disputed as the demonstrations of Euclid.”
Nevertheless, the perfectly safe and efficient variety of
vaccination was neither defined by the witness, nor demanded
by the Committee&mdash;whether with horsegrease
cowpox, cowpox, horsepox, or smallpox cowpox; an
omission that illustrates the slovenly and credulous habit
of those concerned&mdash;a 19th century miracle and mystery,
being under discussion, and matter and mode being taken
for granted under cover of a word!</p>

<p>Throughout Seaton’s evidence, smallpox was treated
as an isolated disease, which might be dealt with specifically
and exterminated without reference to other
fevers, the common mortality being reduced to the extent
of its reduction: no relation being recognised between
fever and fever, epidemic and epidemic&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5344.&mdash;Epidemics of Smallpox, like epidemics of other diseases,
come and go according to laws which we have not made out. They
vary in their intensity, and vary in their power of diffusion. I
have no explanation to offer why the present epidemic (1871) should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
be so much more intense than the epidemic of 1863, any more
than I can tell why the epidemic of 1863 should have been more
severe than the subsequent epidemic of 1866-67; or why one Cholera
or Scarlet Fever epidemic should be so much more fatal than another
Cholera or Scarlet Fever epidemic&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Yet when explanation was offered, namely, that the
febrile disease of a community is a measure of its sanitary
aberrations; that whilst the forms of fevers may vary, the
activity of one form is balanced by the quiescence of
others, the tale of death being equal&mdash;the explanation
was waved aside; and why? Because it did not make
for the glory of vaccination!</p>

<p>Curiously, and for a different reason, Malthus argued,
as we now argue, that if vaccination could exterminate
smallpox, not a life would be saved&mdash;supposing, let us
add, no change effected in the conditions out of which
smallpox and cognate maladies arise. Thus Malthus
wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am far from doubting that millions of human beings have been
destroyed by Smallpox; but were its devastations, as Dr. Haygarth
supposes, many times greater than the Plague, I should still doubt
whether the average population of the earth had been diminished
by them by a single unit. Smallpox is certainly one of the channels,
and a very broad one, which Nature has opened for the last
thousand years to keep down population; but had this been closed
others would have become wider, or new ones would have been
formed. For my own part I feel not the slightest doubt, that, if
the introduction of Cowpox should extirpate Smallpox, we shall
find a very perceptible difference in the increased mortality of some
other diseases.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p></div>

<p>Like Simon and Marson, Seaton had his insult for the
opponents of Smallpox. Simon charged them with ignorance
and dishonesty; and Marson, with the desire to
have their families reduced by smallpox. Seaton held that
they enjoyed martyrdom and courted imprisonment, in
order to get silver watches from their admirers on their
release! Here imputation was self-revelation. Seaton
had won place and pay by his promotion of State vaccination;
and absurdly ascribed to his antagonists his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
venality. Indeed, his evidence throughout was pervaded
by the temper and tactics of the quack, with an end to
promote <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fas et nefas</i>. Asked what would happen if
compulsion were withdrawn from vaccination, he answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5510.&mdash;Simply an awful increase in the mortality from Smallpox,
and a considerable increase therefore in the amount of mortality in
the kingdom.</p></div>

<p>The typical answer of the quack when his dupe hesitates
over his prescription is, “You’ll see then what will
happen!” When vaccination was not compulsory prior
to 1853, nothing “awful” happened; it had been compulsory
for fourteen years in 1871, and yet in 1871 the
kingdom was under experience of the severest smallpox
epidemic of the century! Nevertheless, the anticipation
of Malthus was fulfilled: there was no proof that the
average mortality was increased by a single unit.</p>

<p>The evidence concluded, a draft report was drawn up
by the medical officials, submitted to the Committee, and,
after some trivial alterations, agreed to. The character
of the report may be estimated from this its second
article&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That Cowpox affords, if not an absolute, yet a very great protection
against an attack of Smallpox; and <em>an almost absolute protection
against death from that disease</em>&mdash;</p></div>

<p>And this in face of the fact that deaths from smallpox
among the vaccinated and revaccinated were recorded
by thousands!</p>

<p>Against the evidence in favour of vaccination, the
prevalence of the present (1871) smallpox epidemic,
especially in London, was alleged, and the awkward circumstance
was thus tried to be evaded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Committee, however, believe that, on the one hand, if Vaccination
had not been general, this epidemic might have become a
pestilence as destructive as Smallpox has often been where the
population has been unprotected; and that, on the other hand, if
this preventive had been universal, the epidemic could not have
approached its present extent.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no arguing against what might have been.
When Sangrado’s patients died, he averred that if only
they had been bled more and taken more water, they
would indisputably have recovered; and Sangrado had
believers. So when vaccination does not save from smallpox,
we are assured, “Ah, but it would, if only there had
been more of it.” Descending from fancy to experience,&mdash;from
what <em>might have been</em> to what <em>has been</em>, there is
no record of a worse epidemic in England than that of
1871-72. The only one to compare with it was the epidemic
of 1838-40, which occurred when not 50 per cent.
of the English were vaccinated; but they fared no worse
than in 1871-72, when the number of vaccinated was
doubled.</p>

<p>The proper business of the Committee lay in legislation,
and their report thereon took this form&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There appear to have been several cases of infliction of more than
one fine or imprisonment in regard to the same child; and your
Committee, though by no means admitting the right of the parent
to expose his child or his neighbour’s to the risk of Smallpox, must
express great doubt whether the object of the law is gained by thus
continuing a long contest with the convictions of the parent.</p>

<p>The public opinion of the neighbourhood may sympathise with a
parent thus prosecuted, and may in consequence be excited against
the law; and after all, though the parent be fined or imprisoned,
the child may remain unvaccinated. In such a case the law can
only triumph by the forcible Vaccination of the child.</p>

<p>In enactments of this nature, when the State, in attempting to
fulfil the duty, finds it necessary to disregard the wish of the parent,
it is most important to secure the support of public opinion; and,
as your Committee cannot recommend that a policeman should
be empowered to take a baby from its mother to the Vaccine Station&mdash;a
measure which could only be justified by an extreme necessity,
they would recommend that, whenever in any case two
penalties, or one full penalty (20s.), have been imposed upon a
parent, the magistrate should not impose any further penalty in
respect of the same child.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the parent’s declaration of belief that
Vaccination is injurious might be pleaded against any penalty, but
your Committee believe that if the law were thus changed it would
become a dead letter, prosecutions would soon cease, and the children
of the many apathetic and neglectful parents would be left
unvaccinated, as well as the children of the few opponents of Vaccination.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>The recommendations of the Committee, chiefly administrative,
were embodied in a Bill, passed by the House
of Commons on 15th August. The tenth clause, limiting
penalties, was the subject of a short debate, and was carried
on a division by 57 to 12. When the Bill was brought
before the House of Lords on 18th August, Lord Redesdale
moved to omit clause 10, saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The clause exempts persons who have been fined the full penalty,
or two penalties of any amount, from any further proceedings. The
clause has been hailed with triumph by the opponents of Vaccination,
who justly think it destroys the whole effect of the compulsory
law. The poor will naturally argue that, if the rich are let off
with a fine of 20s., the penalty ought in their case to be reduced;
and such a resistance to the measure will spring up, that the whole
purpose of the former Acts will be done away.</p></div>

<p>Viscount Halifax replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hope the House will not strike out the clause, as it might
entail the loss of the Bill. I admit there are objections to its principle;
but it has been unanimously recommended by a Committee
of the House of Commons. Determined opposition has been offered
to Vaccination by a limited number of persons on grounds which
I deem unreasonable; but, nevertheless, whilst this feeling exists,
it is the opinion of Mr. Simon, the medical officer to the Privy
Council, that it is unwise to insist upon anything which is not indispensable;
and, further, that the penalty now proposed will
answer all the practical purposes of the Act. It is desirable that
public feeling should go with the Act, which will be the case, since
the exceptions will be very few; whereas an adverse feeling may
be excited to the prejudice of the Act, if even a few prosecutions
are persisted in. The strongest advocates of Vaccination deprecate
repeated fines and imprisonments, which leave the defendants’
children unvaccinated.</p></div>

<p>Lord Redesdale rejoined&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I presume the noble Viscount thinks it useless to fine a man
more than once for drunkenness? The clause surrenders the whole
principle of Compulsory Vaccination.</p></div>

<p>On the question whether the clause should stand part
of the Bill, their Lordships divided:&mdash;Contents 7; Non-contents,
8; Majority, 1. Resolved in the negative.</p>

<p>On the 19th August the House of Commons considered
the Lords’ amendment, when Mr. W. E. Forster observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The House of Lords has struck out of the Bill the 10th Clause,
the important clause which mitigates penalties. That clause was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
passed in this House by a majority of 57 to 12, and expunged in
the other House by a majority of 8 to 7, the total number of peers
voting being just equal to the number of members of the Select
Committee which, after long and careful consideration, came to a
unanimous conclusion in favour of the clause. I should have no
hesitation in asking the House to disagree to the amendment, if
the period of the session would allow of such disagreement being
made without loss of the Bill; but as that is not the case, and as
such a course may involve the loss of the Bill, which effects several
great improvements, I fear the House has no choice, and must accept
the amendment. Although the clause is doubtless an important
one, I may remark it is not necessary to other parts of the
Bill, and, with Smallpox raging in the country as it is, I think it
will not be safe to postpone the measure. I regret the omission of
the clause, because in my opinion it strikes a heavy blow at the
principle of Compulsory Vaccination, which their Lordships, as
well as I, think necessary for the health of the country. I move
that the House agree to the Lords’ amendment.</p></div>

<p>Mr. M‘Laren said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whilst I concur in the course proposed, I hope the Government
may lose no time in bringing in a Bill to enact the clause that is
dropped.</p></div>

<p>The motion was agreed to, and repeated penalties continue
to this day.</p>

<p class="noindent">The temper and conduct of Parliament satisfied Mr.
Gibbs and his associates that they must turn again to
the people and achieve success through their instruction,
enlightenment and fears. At this juncture, however,
the labours of Mr. Gibbs terminated. He had married
Miss Griffiths (for many years secretary of the Ladies’
Sanitary Association), and had gone with her on a tour
through the United Kingdom, holding meetings and
discussing the evidence and report of the House of
Commons Committee. His last public appearance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
at Cork; proceeding thence to Dublin, he died there
after a short illness on 1st December, 1871.</p>

<p>The removal of Mr. Gibbs was a severe discouragement;
but a good cause may always be trusted to evolve
its own prophets. Mrs. Gibbs, as became a wise woman,
felt that she could not better honour her husband than
by consecrating herself to his work. She formed the
Mother’s Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League; and
until her own death, 10th November, 1878, devoted her
training, experience and intelligence to awakening an
interest in those divine laws of life of which a practice
like vaccination is a deliberate negation.</p>

<p>In 1872 Mr. John Pickering, of Leeds, in conjunction
with Mr. Henry Pitman, started the <cite>The Anti-Vaccinator</cite>
fortnightly, and continued it for a year. To maintain
such a journal is far from easy. As Napoleon III. observed
to Cobden, “There are a good many free-traders
in France, but you must remember that the people are
not organised, whilst the trades which prey upon the
people are organised and are always alert.” To overthrow
the trade in vaccination, established, endowed
and enforced, is to encounter the enmity and opposition
of the organised profession at whose instigation and for
whose advantage vaccination was established, endowed
and enforced; and to effect the overthrow, it is necessary
to raise up a countervailing force among a public apathetic,
ignorant, and credulous as to medical mysteries.
The overthrow might be thought hopeless were it not
for the leverage afforded by the compulsory law. Every
parent who has wisdom and love enough to refuse to
have his child vaccinated, is enabled to bear his testimony
in court, to have it certified by fine or imprisonment,
and to have his triumph published for encouragement
and repetition. There is no preaching like such practice,
for which the evil law itself provides opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickering was fined over and over again, and in
his <cite>Anti-Vaccinator</cite> he proved abundantly that he had
reason and science without end for his steadfast resistance
to the legalised superstition. In 1876 he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
enabled to strike a blow for the truth not likely to be
forgotten, especially in Yorkshire. The statistics of the
Leeds Smallpox Hospital had been published after the
fashion of similar concoctions&mdash;an insignificant mortality
among the vaccinated being set against a prodigious
mortality among the unvaccinated. The statistics were
denounced as fictitious, and proof of the accusation being
demanded, Mr. Pickering produced the proof.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The requisite
inquiry was tedious and difficult; and because
tedious and difficult it was presumed it would never be
attempted, and that impunity was assured. The exposure
demonstrated afresh how little dependence is to be placed
on the collocation of figures by those whose pride and
interest are committed to a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>The severity of the compulsory law is subject to
frequent abatement in its administration by poor law
guardians. They appoint and pay vaccination officers,
and it is for them to consider and, to sanction repeated
prosecutions. Hence a majority, or an energetic minority
of guardians adverse to vaccination may do much to
frustrate its public administration. What is practicable
in this way was shown by the Keighley guardians in
1876. They declined to prosecute; they disregarded the
admonitions of the Local Government Board; and they refused
to obey a mandamus issued from the Queen’s Bench.
They were thereon arrested for contempt of court, and
committed to York Castle, from which they were released
after nominal submission. They were re-elected
by the ratepayers, and did as before, but more discreetly.</p>

<p>There is a proverb about taking a horse to the water
and trying to make him drink, which applies to legislation
when equally disliked by those expected to enforce
it and by those on whom it is to be enforced. Under
such conditions the compulsory act is of no effect in
Keighley: those who like may be vaccinated, and those
who do not, need not. The majority are unvaccinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
and nowhere is smallpox less feared. In several towns
where public sentiment is similarly enlightened, something
of the same freedom is enjoyed. In many parishes
it is the rule to disallow repeated prosecutions: the vaccination
officer fulfils his commission in prosecuting once,
and then his hand is stayed. In some parishes those
who are known to be opposed to vaccination are passed
over on the tacit understanding that they keep quiet as
to their indulgence; a course of procedure extremely
injurious to the good cause, damping enthusiasm and
suppressing that conflict and agitation by which it
prospers. In other parishes no quarter is allowed: the
law is worked with rigour. Prosecution follows prosecution
until either fury exhausts itself, or the nonconformist
is driven elsewhere.</p>

<p>Such persistent prosecution often becomes a public
scandal. To a parent with adequate means, the fines
and costs are trivial, and are amply repaid by the satisfaction
of setting guardians and justices at defiance, and
publishing far and wide his contempt for the vaccine
superstition. On the other hand, a parent in humble
circumstances is often put to cruel straits between his
love and duty to his child and the comfort of conformity.</p>

<p>In the difficulty thus created by the law, the Local
Government Board is frequently appealed to for advice;
and in 1876 the Board, at that time under the presidency
of Mr. Sclater-Booth, addressed a letter of counsel to the
Evesham guardians, which, translated from official circumlocution,
came to this&mdash;Prosecute until you are
satisfied your antagonist cannot be overcome: then consider
whether you had not better desist; for he may
obtain sympathy, and the law and the rite alike suffer
discredit in public estimation. In Cowper’s words, “Safe
policy, but hateful.” This Evesham letter has become a
standard document, and is regularly posted by the Board
to guardians in perplexity as to the extent of vengeance
they should execute. Such is the variety of valour
taught from Whitehall&mdash;“Fight until you discover you
are not likely to prevail; and take care to leave off before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
you make yourselves hateful or ridiculous.” Law was
never, perhaps, reduced to baser terms.</p>

<p>Several attempts have been made to modify the law
as recommended by the Vaccination Committee of 1871
and approved by the House of Commons. Mr. Pease
(now Sir Joseph) introduced a bill with that purpose in
1872 and 1878, limiting the penalty in any case to 20s.,
but without success. In 1880 the Gladstone administration,
fresh from the country, and flushed with good intentions,
brought forward a similar bill, but dropped it in
abject fright in consequence of the clamour of the medical
trade unions, who fancied their vested interest in vaccination
endangered. Nevertheless, those responsible for
the law at the Local Government Board avow their disapprobation
of repeated prosecutions, and regret that
Parliament does not appear to be of a like mind, reckless
of the fact that Parliament is rarely unwilling to consent
to an administrative change when those in authority
state the reasons for it, and insist on the necessity of
giving them effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Forster, when moving for the Committee of 1871
in the House of Commons, spoke as if no member was
prepared to dispute the efficacy of vaccination against
smallpox; and, though the assumption was excessive, it
was not far from correct. Even Mr. Candlish only objected
to the injustice of compulsion. Since then considerable
progress has been made. Mr. P. A. Taylor, who
shared the position of Mr. Candlish, subsequently examined
the history and evidences of vaccination for himself,
with the inevitable result: he discovered that he had
been imposed upon, and having made sure, straightway
began to make known his discovery to others. Mr. C.
H. Hopwood, equally enlightened, moved Parliament for
various statistical returns which exhibited the influence
of enforced vaccination, in authentic form and on a
national scale, as a factor of death and a communicator
and aggravator of other maladies. In conjunction, Mr.
Taylor and Mr. Hopwood have raised the standard of
resistance to vaccination in the House of Commons; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
what Mr. Forster in 1871 set forth as indisputable, is
now openly and unanswerably disputed; for those who
have come to the defence, like Sir Lyon Playfair and Sir
Charles Dilke, have been convicted of unquestionable
mis-statements which could only pass muster as addressed
to uncritical credulity.</p>

<p>Parliament is the creature of public opinion, and to
arouse and inform that opinion and to bring it to fruit
in legislation, it is necessary to agitate and to organise.
Consequent on the death of Mr. R. B. Gibbs in 1871, the
League, of which he was leader, underwent a course
of vicissitude until, in 1876, it was revived under the
presidency of Mr. William Hume-Rothery, with the
<cite>National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter</cite> for
its organ, edited by Mrs. Hume-Rothery. The energy
and ability which Mr. and Mrs. Hume-Rothery have
brought to their arduous enterprise have been unwearied
and conspicuous&mdash;their self-consecration has been unreserved.
Sometimes they have been charged with vehemence
and intolerance, but when we consider the craft
with which they are confronted on one side, and the credulity
on the other, the misery and mortality resulting
from the cruel practice, and the monstrous oppression
exercised on those who resist the despicable superstition,
it is not easy to be calm, or to adjust invective to a
scruple. “Thou shouldst not speak so strongly, John,”
said a Friend to her husband, when denouncing some
iniquity. “Ah! Jane,” he replied, “thou knowest not
what I keep back.”</p>

<p>It is frequently said that anti-vaccinators are fanatical,
which may be more or less true; but if in quest of fanaticism,
where shall we find it so ruthless, so untruthful,
or so mercenary as among vaccinators? Take for example,
Jenner, or Ring, or Seaton, or Marson, or Simon.
The fury of anti-vaccinators stands excused by the
strongest reason that can justify or ennoble fury. If a
father has a child injured or killed by vaccination, and
is threatened (as is often the case) with a second attack
on his family life, with what temper may he be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
to regard the law? When Macduff’s children were
slaughtered, it was only in Macbeth’s blood that he could
ease his soul, and with Macduff goes the sympathy of
every human heart. So it is with those bereaved by
vaccination; only for them there is no personal Macbeth
to receive his deserts, but a bodiless law.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to philosophise over other people’s
wrongs, or advise forbearance where there is no sense of
hurt; but fury and indignation constitute the natural
reaction against outrage and injustice, and where feeble
or absent denote defective moral sensibility. Nevertheless,
fury and indignation are poorly spent if allowed to
exhaust themselves in vituperation. Their proper use
is to give vigour to action, and, invested in prudence, to
achieve swift and sure redemption. Wise is the advice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Prune thou thy words, the thoughts control</p>
<p class="verse2">That o’er thee swell and throng:</p>
<p class="verse0">They will condense within thy soul,</p>
<p class="verse2">And change to purpose strong.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The National League holds an annual conference in
some convenient centre, to which representatives from
affiliated societies are appointed. Many of these societies
co-operate for the defence of their members under prosecution;
they organise public meetings and discussions;
provide lectures; distribute tracts; bring to light vaccination
disasters; frustrate the attempts of medical men
to get up smallpox panics; and, in short, to do all in their
power to turn confidence aside from a magical, misleading
and mischievous prescription to trust in the common
conditions of health, as verified by science and continual
experience.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that these societies excite much
annoyance and evoke much bad language from the practitioners
whose craft they discredit and despoil. Thus, for
example, the British Medical Association, in a petition
addressed to Government in 1879, protesting against any
relaxation of the compulsory law, and signed by several
thousand members of the profession, gave voice to the
trade grievance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The outcry against Compulsory Vaccination is mainly due to
certain interested persons [<em>interested in what?</em>] who, by the dissemination
of inflammatory literature and distorted statements,
stir up opposition to Vaccination on the part of ignorant and thoughtless
people.</p></div>

<p>Here what is wished to be taken for true is set forth
as fact. Whatever the opponents of vaccination may be,
they are neither ignorant or thoughtless, nor do they influence
the ignorant and thoughtless. On the contrary,
it is their exact acquaintance with the history and
theories, the inutility and dangers of the multiform rite,
designated vaccination, which renders them such dangerous
and disagreeable antagonists. Further be it said,
compulsory acquaintance with vaccination has been for
thousands an introduction to vigorous intellectual life.
It has demonstrated the fallibility of authority, and how
it is possible for what is accounted established beyond
dispute to be false to the core. Certain it is that ere
long vaccination will be ranked among the crassest of
human follies, and what force that exposure will lend to
scepticism in conflict with other forms of conventional
opinion, may be left to the consideration of the judicious
reader.</p>

<p>The London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory
Vaccination was formed in 1880 with objects thus defined&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1.&mdash;The Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The Diffusion of Knowledge concerning Vaccination.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The Maintenance of an Office in London for the Publication
of Literature relating to Vaccination, and as a Centre of Action and
Information.</p></div>

<p>An office was opened in Victoria Street, Westminster,
with Mr. William Young, as secretary, and <cite>The Vaccination
Inquirer</cite>, established by Mr. William Tebb in 1879,
was adopted as the organ of the Society. The executive
committee, liberally assisted by the Countess de Noailles,
Mr. P. A. Taylor, Mr. Tebb, and others, have been
enabled to make many and visible marks on public
opinion, which by all means possible they are ever intent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
to repeat. Mr. J. G. Talbot, M.P. for Oxford University,
took early opportunity to stigmatise the London Society
as a Murder League, and Dr. Barrow, president of the
British Medical Association in 1881, as “a Disgrace to
Humanity”&mdash;these and similar amenities being taken as
badges of honour and tokens of success. The London
Society has also actively co-operated in successive International
Anti-Vaccination Congresses&mdash;at Paris in 1880,
at Cologne in 1881, and at Berne in 1883.</p>

<p>Of late years the literature of anti-vaccination has been
steadily increasing in volume, variety and power. A
notable effort to bring the question within range of common
apprehension was the publication in 1876 of <cite>Our
Medicine Men</cite>, by Mr. H. Strickland Constable. Apart
from vaccination, <cite>Our Medicine Men</cite> is a pleasant book,
full of anecdote, good humour, shrewdness and excellent
philosophy, not likely to be forgotten by those who make
its acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>A series of <cite>Vaccination Tracts</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> fourteen in number,
was commenced by Mr. Wm. Young in 1877 and completed
by Dr. Garth Wilkinson in 1879. Fuseli, reproaching
his contemporaries for their indifference to Flaxman,
said, “You English, you see with your ears”; and Fuseli’s
observation recurs as we think of the limited repute of
Dr. Wilkinson; not that any more than Flaxman he is unknown,
but because he is so <em>inadequately</em> known, probably
because he is so frequently at variance with the
fashionable science of the day, nor has paid court to its
fashionable professors. Nevertheless, those who have
sense and courage to recognise what is admirable without
direction find in these <cite>Tracts</cite> not only vaccination
made an end of, but thoughts new and deep, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
felicities of diction and cadence that every connoisseur in
words must appreciate and revert to with delight. However
wide our acquaintance with English literature, a
variety of singular affluence and originality remains
until Dr. Garth Wilkinson has been discovered.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that all medical men believe in
vaccination in one or any of its varieties. Those who use
their eyes and are not bewitched by prescription or self-interest,
recognise the failure and disasters of the practice,
but may not care to set themselves at open variance
with their profession. Many privately confess their vanishing
or vanished faith in the rite, adding, perhaps, that
its dangers are exaggerated, and that it does little harm
with due precaution, whilst affording a comfortable sense
of security to its recipients. Others go further, and wish
the discredit of compulsion were removed from the practice,
when they would leave it to their patients to decide
for themselves to vaccinate or not to vaccinate, they disowning
responsibility. A nobler few decline to hold any
terms of compromise with the imposture, and among these
Mr. Enoch Robinson is conspicuous. He has lectured and
debated against vaccination, and by his temperate and
competent advocacy has made converts of the most unwilling
and prejudiced. Moved by a popular compilation
in defence of vaccination, he published a reply to it in
1880, entitled, <cite>Can Disease protect Health?</cite><a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>&mdash;a polemic
cogent and perspicuous, and ingenuous as its opposite was
the reverse. As illustrative of the character of the medical
press, it may be mentioned that advertisements of Mr.
Robinson’s pamphlet were declined by <cite>The Lancet</cite> and
<cite>The British Medical Journal</cite>, it being their rule to exclude
announcements injurious to the interests involved
in vaccination&mdash;surely in such quarters a superfluous
precaution. Some people appear to fancy that intolerance
is a peculium of theologians; but they would find
abundant cause for a different opinion if familiar with
the medical world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that inasmuch as the rising generation of
medical men are more roundly educated than their predecessors,
they are likely to deal with vaccination in a
more scientific and independent spirit. The experience
of Dr. W. J. Collins at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital lends
reason to the anticipation. Study and observation confirmed
Dr. Collins in his father’s practical judgment,
which he has re-stated firmly and temperately on proper
occasions; supporting it with the wide and open evidence
at his command. He has been heard with patience and
favour, nor has he encountered any but honourable
opposition; proving how much depends on the manner
in which a man fights his battle, and how much is conceded
to courage with courtesy. Dr. Collins has argued,
“Ought Vaccination to be enforced?” before the Abernethian
Society; he has met Dr. W. B. Carpenter in
public debate; he has discussed the Vaccination Disaster
at Norwich in 1882; he has answered Sir Lyon Playfair;
and he has brought the doctrine of evolution to
bear on the generation of disease.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> If sometimes we refer
to the medical profession with severity, the recollection
of members like Dr. Collins operates as a check. Still
we must be just. Professions, like kindred trade unions,
are controlled by their interests, and there never was
church, or community, or corporation which surrendered
any source of gain, save by external compulsion. Public
vaccination in England represents a medical endowment
of £100,000 annually, which the profession, true to the
law of its being, cannot renounce voluntarily; and there
is no sense in shutting our eyes to that certainty. Of
course, it would be absurd to charge medical men
individually with defending vaccination because of the
gain attached thereto: nothing of the kind is intended:
but as Hobbes observed of mankind in the gross, “Even
the axioms of geometry would be disputed if their
interests were peculiarly affected by them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, it is said that vaccination is a medical
question which may be left to medical men to settle,
the answer is&mdash;“Nay: vaccination is paid for out of the
public pocket, and whatever the evidence adverse to its
usefulness, it will be upheld as beneficial by those who
profit by it. If those who pay do not object, those who
are paid never will. In face of common experience, we
hold it cannot be otherwise.”</p>

<p>There are fashions in medicine as in millinery: they
are started; they flourish; they pass away; but the permanence
of any medical fashion might be secured if
fortified by endowment. Venesection was once in vogue;
now it is scarcely known; but if in its heyday a law had
been passed for its performance at the public expense, a
ring of official venesectors would have been created to
justify the practice against all gainsayers; to deny or
explain away every disaster and fatality; and at all
hazards preserve its credit from reproach; whilst it
would cost something like a constitutional struggle for
the nation to escape from the imposition. It is thus with
vaccination. Left to itself, it would, like venesection,
have dropped into disuse; but it acquired permanence
from the initial error&mdash;the endowment of the National
Vaccine Establishment in 1808.</p>

<p>The enforcement of vaccination supplies a yet stronger
reason for public interference. A church endowed by
the State might be endured by Dissenters, but if submission
to any of its offices were made compulsory, endurance
would give place to active resistance. Such is
the case with vaccination. As it is endowed and enforced,
it is hopeless to try to reserve it from general discussion
and denunciation. Since citizens are liable to fine and
imprisonment who withhold their children from the
lancet, it becomes their duty to satisfy themselves as to
the character of the operation for which they are taxed,
and with which their families are menaced; and should
their convictions be adverse to its utility and safety, they
cannot do their fellow-citizens better service than by
bearing the testimony of open resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus vaccination is translated to politics and made
every man’s business; whilst the interest created by its
endowment and enforcement deprives its medical advocates
of judicial authority in the controversy. It would
be as reasonable to expect slaveholders to denounce
slavery, or protected manufacturers to advocate free
trade as for those whose professional prestige and advantage
are involved in the practice to speak the truth about
vaccination. Let us be reasonable. Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? We should not
require of average human nature the virtue of its rarer
forms. Like all monopolies, vaccination endowed and
enforced, is defended with unanimity from within, and
must be attacked and overthrown from without&mdash;nevertheless
be it said with <em>some</em> assistance from within, and
that assistance most efficient.</p>

<p>It is therefore no cause for surprise that a large share
in the agitation against compulsory vaccination has fallen
to laymen. Mr. George S. Gibbs (cousin of John Gibbs
and brother of R. B. Gibbs) has for thirty years maintained
a criticism, chiefly statistical, of the official
defences of vaccination, characterised throughout by an
accuracy which has never been impugned.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Mr. H. D. Dudgeon has been described as “a veritable
and venerable apostle of health.” With a consummate
knowledge of hygiene, and a profound faith in its power
to overcome zymotic disease, he has set forth its principles
with such lucidity and persistency that he has
gone far to educate Leicester in setting at naught the
vaccine superstition. To the standard assertion of the
vaccinators, that sanitation is good against all febrile
affections, except smallpox, for which there is no preventive
save vaccination (the sovereign variety being
conveniently undefined) he has been an opponent merciless
as truth. Regret is frequently expressed that the
abundant information and admirable sense which pervade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
Mr. Dudgeon’s writing have been confined to newspapers
and occasional pamphlets, but it is probable his teaching
has been all the more fruitful because adapted to
immediate circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The word spoken in due
season how good it is!</p>

<p>The name of Mr. Alexander Wheeler of Darlington is
familiar wherever vaccination is brought under discussion.
Mr. Wheeler’s interest in the subject was first excited,
he writes, by Mr. G. S. Gibbs, “whose scepticism
as to its virtue seemed to me absurd”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Gibbs inquired whether I had examined the question, and
when I confessed that I had not, he asked if I would read Baron’s
<cite>Life of Dr. Jenner</cite>. Nothing loath, I accepted the loan of the
volumes. Doubts began to trouble me with the first volume, and
the second quite upset my confidence in Vaccination as a positive
preventive of Smallpox. I then set to work to ascertain with what
care I could, whether there was any truth in the assertion that
Vaccination diminished Smallpox or modified its virulence. The
process of determination was not rapid, but long before I had
formed a definite opinion, I was satisfied that <em>Compulsory</em> Vaccination
was indefensible; and my first efforts were directed to the
protection of my own children from the infliction. Unsatisfied as
to what Vaccination was, or what the Vaccinator effected, I clearly
saw that the State had no right to enforce a practice by no means
harmless, nor preventive of Smallpox, nor easy to explain the
use of.</p></div>

<p>As lecturer, debater and newspaper controversialist,
Mr. Wheeler has acquired well-earned distinction. Knowing
far more of vaccination, its history, varieties,
consequences, and statistics than his adversaries, they
are usually overthrown with a dexterity realised as
horrible and astonishing. Like savages with bows and
arrows, they come forth in the innocence of faith to
encounter arms of precision. In 1878 Mr. Wheeler held
a debate with Dr. George Wyld, an enthusiastic advocate
of the cowpox discarded by Jenner as impotent against
smallpox. Sir Thomas Chambers presided, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
question discussed being, “Is Vaccination worthy of
National Support?” How rash and how futile was Dr.
Wyld’s championship is recorded in the report of the
debate.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Mr. William Tebb is another well-known name in connection
with the movement against vaccination. For a
time dubious, his attention was quickened and his course
decided by the summons of the St. Pancras guardians to
have his daughter, Beatrice, vaccinated. His refusal was
followed by prosecution after prosecution in the Marylebone
police-court, until at last the guardians gave up the
contest as hopeless.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> It was a bad day for vaccination
when the compulsory law was applied to Mr. Tebb. As
with many others, persecution made of him an inflexible
and active antagonist. His tongue, his pen, and his
purse, coupled with untiring industry and eminent executive
ability, have been devoted to the exposure and
overthrow of the conjoint superstition and tyranny. Mr.
Tebb is a fine exemplification of Sir T. Fowell Buxton’s
opinion, “Vigour, energy, resolution, firmness of purpose&mdash;these
carry the day. Is there one whom difficulties
dishearten, who bends to the storm? He will do little.
Is there one who will conquer? That kind of man never
fails:” adding, “The longer I live, the more I am certain
that the great difference between men, between the feeble
and the powerful, is energy&mdash;invincible determination, a
purpose once fixed, and then death or victory. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
quality will do anything that can he done in this
world.”<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Mr. P. A. Taylor’s speeches in the House of Commons
have been widely read, but his Letter to Dr. W. B. Carpenter
has been, perhaps, the most effective contribution
to the good cause.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Dr. Carpenter had volunteered for
the defence of vaccination, and had challenged Mr. Taylor;
and being of a credulous and uncritical habit of
mind, he collected and recited the various legends and
factitious statistics that form the body of vaccination,
with additions from his private resources; thus constituting
himself an objective of attack, and providing Mr.
Taylor with an excellent opportunity. Mr. Taylor accepted
the challenge: he captured and destroyed Dr.
Carpenter’s positions seriatim, leaving him routed and
helpless. The Letter has had an immense circulation,
and its influence on public opinion is manifesting itself
in a thousand ways. Neither Dr. Carpenter nor any
vaccinator has ventured to reply to Mr. Taylor; the fact
being that no reply is possible. Any one who attentively
reads Mr. Taylor’s Letter cannot fail to perceive
that the practice represented by Dr. Carpenter is rooted
in illusion and imposture. Silence under the circumstances
may therefore pass for discretion: silence on Dr.
Carpenter’s part possesses a significance it would be difficult
to misinterpret. Indeed, none know better than
those responsible for vaccination as a medical interest,
that the less it is brought under discussion the more
likely it is to endure. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quieta non movere</i> is their motto;
and officious champions like Dr. Carpenter have little
thanks for their restlessness.</p>

<p>Correspondence in newspapers is a well-recognised
means for the diffusion of new ideas, and in the use of
this means the opponents of vaccination have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
no little distinction. There is an increasing number
throughout the country who not only know their own
case, but the case of their adversaries better than do
their adversaries themselves; and if an editor has grace
enough to maintain a fair field and show no favour, the
issue is invariably satisfactory. Two able correspondents,
who have gone hence, are especially worthy of mention&mdash;Andrew
Leighton and William Gibson Ward. Mr.
Leighton was a Liverpool merchant, who, having become
interested in the vaccination question, made its discussion
the occupation of his leisure. With a clear and logical
mind, patient, sagacious, and tolerant, prejudice itself
could scarcely withstand his sweet reasonableness. Almost
to the day of his death, 14th January, 1877, he was
engaged in newspaper controversy, each letter bearing
witness to his admirable temper and persuasive power.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Mr. Ward of Perriston Towers was a man of wide reading
and perfervid character, who wrote and talked after
the manner of Cobbett, whom in many respects he resembled.
Having discovered the truth as concerned vaccination,
he applied himself vigorously and successfully
to its diffusion. He sustained his prosecution as a parent
with the joy of one who delights in battle; and, indeed,
as it was said, a periodical prosecution would have suited
him exactly, providing him with occasion for a rousing
speech in court and a discussion with the bench, to be
duly reported in the Herefordshire newspapers. Mr. Ward
died 18th October, 1882. Latterly he had access to <cite>The
Times</cite>, and followed up a series of letters on subjects he
had made his own with one on which he argued, that
smallpox was neither an unmixed evil, nor a cause of
extra mortality.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>To enter into a closer enumeration of those engaged
in the movement against vaccination would be invidious
and bound to imperfection. Still it would be grateful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
refer to the various services of veterans like Sir Jervoise
Clarke Jervoise, Mr. Thomas Baker, Dr. Edward Haughton,
Mr. T. B. Brett of St. Leonards, Mr. Edmund Proctor
of Newcastle, Mr. John Lucas of Gateshead, Mr. R. A.
Milner of Keighley, Mr. W. F. Fox of Dewsbury, Dr. E. J.
Crow of Ripon, Mr. Francis Davis, jun., of Enniscorthy, Mr.
Wm. Thurlow of Sudbury, Mr. Wm. Adair of Maryport,
Mr. Charles Gillett of Banbury, Dr. T. L. Nichols, Mr.
James Burns, and Mr. Amos Booth of Leicester. These
and others have borne the odium of despised truth, and
live to see it steadily acquiring favour and force, whilst
the delusion to which it is opposed is entering the region
of scepticism preparatory to dispersion and contempt.</p>

<p>All means are good against evil, but deeds are more
than words; and talk against vaccination counts far less
than resistance to its infliction. The more who are withheld
from the rite, the more live to prove its inutility;
and the more the law designed to enforce is set at defiance,
the surer and sooner will be its overthrow. Nevertheless,
let us not forget what this warfare costs, nor how we are
indebted to the men and women, brave, tender, and
true, by whom it is endured. As a rule, the rich are
exempt: the contest is with the poor. As Mrs. Jacob
Bright says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I object to Compulsory Vaccination because it is an outrageous
piece of class legislation. No one in easy circumstances, no one
possessing the luxury of a family doctor, need have his child vaccinated.
He has only to tell his family doctor that he objects to
Vaccination, and the matter is at an end. Did ever any one hear
of a family doctor who threatened to prosecute the head of a family
for nonconformity in this respect? I think not. But the family
doctor of the poor is the parish doctor. He is quite independent
of his patient, and being paid by other people to vaccinate them,
he not only vaccinates them in many cases against their will, but
he does it <em>when</em> he likes, and with <em>what</em> virus he likes, irrespective
of the feelings or opinions they may entertain.</p>

<p>I was riding some time ago in Sherwood Forest, and stopped to
ask for a glass of water at a cottage, where a poor woman was
standing with her fat little baby in her arms. I said, “You’ve got a
pretty boy there. Has he been vaccinated?” The mother’s face,
which was glowing with pride at praise of her boy, suddenly fell,
and she said, “No, madam, he hasn’t, but he’ll have to be. We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
lost one through it,” she added, with tears in her eyes. She is one
of a great number of poor people who, rightly or wrongly, believe
that Vaccination is dangerous, and yet are not able to resist the
pressure put upon them to vaccinate; they are too poor, and in
most cases have not the spirit to resist.</p>

<p>I say that it is disgraceful to fine and imprison people for forming
an independent opinion on a medical question; and it is particularly
disgraceful that my poor neighbour should be thus persecuted
when I am free, absolutely free, to please myself whether my children
shall be vaccinated. It is not possible that this thing can
continue.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p></div>

<p>The contest, be it repeated, is with the poor. “There
is no getting over the fact,” says Dr. John Scott of Manchester,
“that vaccination is hated among the working
class, in Lancashire, at least.” Vaccination is hated, and
rightly hated, and the law is set to overcome that hatred.
Multitudes submit because they either know not how, or
dread to do otherwise; but an honourable and increasing
number prefer the better part&mdash;holding by what they
recognise for right, resolved to obey God rather than
man. It has been said, “The days of martyrdom, like
those of miracles, have ceased”; but have they? The
record of humble English folk, who, during the past
thirty years, have withstood the infamous Vaccination
Acts, bears witness to the contrary. Martyrdom and
heroism are rarely recognised by those who occasion or
dislike their manifestation: it is sympathy that opens
the eyes to their appearance. Unknown or despised,
these medical nonconformists have stood true to their
faith in the order of nature against doctor-craft, and
have counted nothing dear to them if so be they could
preserve their children and conscience from outrage.
They have been prosecuted with all the malice and
pertinacity of petty authority&mdash;of Justice Shallow and
Bumble; have been insulted from the judgment seat;
have been fined to the uttermost farthing and loaded
with uttermost costs, and this repeatedly; have had their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
goods and furniture distrained, and their homes broken
up; have been sent to jail with hard labour, and subjected
to every indignity and cruelty of the prison-house;
have been hunted from parish to parish, and in despair
driven to exile. And these have been Englishmen, the
law English, and the time our own! The Master of the
Rolls recently observed, “What is contrary to the feelings
of every honest man cannot be the law of England&mdash;or,
if it be, the sooner it ceases to be law the better.” It
would be unfair to charge the injustice of the Vaccination
Acts to the English people. To most of them their
character and operation are unknown. The chief
sufferers are hidden under the hatches of poverty, and
are unable to make the land resound with their wrongs.
Those, too, who essay to speak for them are confronted
with that obdurate dulness with which the early Free-Traders
had to contend when restriction was thought to
be as good for commerce as cowpox is thought to be
good for health in stopping smallpox. Mr. Bright, in
praising the speeches of Mr. Villiers at Birmingham,
29th January, 1884, remarked&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I mention their publication to revive the strange and painful
fact that during the years when those speeches&mdash;so convincing,
so absolutely unanswerable, were spoken in the House of
Commons, they were addressed, as it were, to men morally stone
deaf. The arguments were not answered, the facts adduced were
not disproved, the appalling suffering of the people was not denied.</p></div>

<p>A similar deafness to the oppression of compulsory
vaccination prevails, though there are signs of awakening.
Still it is not for those who suffer to wait on politicians.
The words are trite, but true as trite&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse16">“Know ye not,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow?”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Many are discovering that in union is strength. Combinations
for mutual protection and insurance against
penalties are multiplying. Resist and Organise is their
watchword: organise, study the law, find out its weak
places, make the most of them, harass its administrators,
vote only for guardians who are opposed to compulsion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
and, in short, do whatever is possible to frustrate the
pernicious legislation.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is asked, “Why not obey the law and
agitate for its repeal?” but the suggestion is designed
for stultification. Suppose the Society of Friends had
consented to take oaths until the law was adjusted to
their consciences, would they not have been swearing to
this day? Suppose some dissenters had not refused to
pay church rates, when would church rates have been
abolished? Suppose the Irish had submitted to English
rule until convinced by reason of the wickedness and
folly of their domination, how long would they have had
to wait for the redress of their wrongs? Such questions
might be run over pages, but to what purpose? All
know (unless submerged in cant) that those who would
have must take; and that no man’s rights can be entrusted
to another’s good-will, be the trustee ever so just.
Vaccination is a medical monopoly established, endowed,
and enforced&mdash;a tyranny to be overthrown. Those who
profit by it will never consent to its surrender, whatever the
evidence of its inutility and mischief: it would be against
experience to expect otherwise: and they will never
be so valiant in defence of their monopoly, and so profuse
in the assertion of its overwhelming advantages, as
when its dissolution is imminent. The wise understand
these things. There is, therefore, but one way in which
to get rid of the incubus, and that way is outright resistance.
Already such resistance has proved successful in
several parts of the country. The law has been reduced
to abeyance, and similar resistance will be rewarded with
similar results. Moreover, further legislation in favour
of vaccination has been checked. Parliament will pass
no more Vaccination Acts. The plague thus far is
stayed: the worst possible has been seen: the business
is to clear away what remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is sometimes said that vaccination is unnatural, and
the saying is disregarded as unscientific or absurd. But
is it unscientific? and is it absurd? Men deserve an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
order in Nature, and when they perceive that any procedure
is at variance with that order, they instinctively
condemn it as unnatural, though possibly they may be
unable to give a philosophic account of their aversion.</p>

<p>We unite in the assertion that vaccination is unnatural,
and when we are asked, Why? we answer, Because it is
an operation which violates the order maintained in the
formation of the blood. If we follow food into the
stomach and attend to the processes of digestion, rejection,
and assimilation&mdash;the infinite care, in short, with
which blood is made, we shall start back with dislike,
and even horror, from a practice which sets at naught all
this care; which attacks the blood directly, and attacks
it to poison it. Hence it is that vaccination is stigmatised
as unnatural, being a process which not only reverses the
course of Nature in blood-making, but doubly unnatural,
as violating that course and poisoning its product.</p>

<p>To re-affirm and illustrate our meaning, we take the
following piece of physiological poetry, poetic yet scientifically
accurate, from Dr. Garth Wilkinson&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the human body, whatever enters the blood, be it even the
most bland food, the juice of the grape or the pomegranate, or the
fine flour of wheat, be it oil, wine, or fig, is broken up first, and
then led inwards through long avenues of introduction. The most
innocent food goes in most easily and first. The police and surveillance
for the rest are exceeding great and many. The senses
electively appetise the fine food; it has to pass through their
peremptory doors of liking and disliking; instructed doors of
memory, association, imagination, reason, wisdom, religion, in
adults. It is then attacked by digestive salivas, tests, examinations,
and severe juices, and questioned to the uttermost in that
degree, which corresponds to the former. It is strained through
organ after organ; each a tribunal of more than social exactitude.
It is absorbed by the finest systems of choice in pore and vessel,
organic judgment sitting in every corner, and presiding over each
inner doorway. It is submitted to glandular and lung purifications,
and their furnaces of trials and eliminations. At last it is
weighed in the balances, and minted by supreme nerve wisdoms;
and only after all these processes is it admitted into the golden
blood. This of the best food, such as good and wise men eat. The
worst food is made the best of by a constant passage through bodily
mercies and mitigations&mdash;a no less sedulous though a penal process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
This is physiology, and divine-human decency, and like a man’s
life. Vaccination traverses and tramples upon all these safeguards
and wisdoms; it goes direct to the blood, or, still worse, to the
lymph, and not with food; it puts poison, introduced by puncture,
and that has no test applicable to it, and can have no character
given to it but that it is fivefold animal and human poison, at a
blow into the very centre, thus otherwise guarded by nature in the
providence of God. This is blood assassination, and like a
murderer’s life.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p></div>

<p>Finally, vaccination is an attempt to swindle Nature.
The vaccinator says, “Come, my little dear, come and
let me give you a disease wherewith I shall so hoax
Nature that henceforth you may live in what stench
you please, and smallpox shall not catch you.” But
can Nature be swindled? can Nature be hoaxed? Mr.
Lowell, in praising the genius of Cervantes, says, “There
is a moral in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, and a very profound one
it is&mdash;that whoever quarrels with Nature, whether
wittingly or unwittingly, is certain to get the worst of
it.” There is sometimes an apparent triumph over
Nature. We do wrong, and fancy we may evade the
penalty by some cunning contrivance, but ere long we perceive
with dismay that the consequences were only concealed
or staved off, and that we have to answer to the
uttermost farthing. Vaccination is a dodge kindred with
incantations and similar performances whereby it is
hoped to circumvent the order of the Highest, and compel
his favour apart from obedience to his will. By
artifice it is attempted to obviate a consequence of ill-living,
whilst persisting in ill-living; but if it were
possible to escape smallpox by such means, we should
have equal punishment in some other mode. No: smallpox
with its alternatives and equivalents can only be
avoided through compliance with the old-fashioned prescription,
“Wash you, make you clean; cease to do evil,
learn to do well.” The lesson is hard to learn, and
harder to practise; but there is no evading it if we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
be healthy and happy. Wherefore all tricks like vaccination
are bound to nullity and disaster. As Hosea
Biglow says&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WILLIAM A. GUY, F.R.C.P., F.R.S.</p>

<p>Is Vaccination a preventive of Smallpox? To this question there is,
there can be, no answer except such as is couched in the language of
figures.&mdash;<cite>Journal of the Statistical Society</cite>, 1882, vol. xlv. p. 414.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">G. F. KOLB,</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Member of the Royal Statistical Commission of Bavaria.</cite></p>

<p>From childhood I had been trained to look upon Cowpox as an
absolute protective from Smallpox. I believed in Vaccination more
strongly than in any ecclesiastical dogma. Numerous and acknowledged
failures did not shake my faith. I attributed them either to
the carelessness of the operator or the badness of the lymph.</p>

<p>In course of time the question of Compulsory Vaccination came before
the Reichstag, when a medical friend supplied me with a mass of statistics
in favour of Vaccination, in his opinion, conclusive and unanswerable.
This awoke the statistician within me. On inspection, I found
the figures delusive; and closer examination left no shadow of doubt in
my mind that the statistical array of proof represented a complete
failure.</p>

<p>My investigations were continued, and my judgment was confirmed.
For instance, Cowpox was introduced to Bavaria in 1807, and for a long
time none, except the newly-born, escaped Vaccination; nevertheless
in the epidemic of 1871, of 30,472 cases of Smallpox, no less than 29,429
were vaccinated, as is shown in the documents of the State.&mdash;<em>From
Letter to</em> <span class="smcap">Mr. William Tebb</span>, <em>22nd January, 1882</em>.</p></div>

a Disease discovered in some of the Western Counties of England,
particularly Gloucestershire, and known by the name of
the Cow Pox.</cite> London: 1798.</p>

<p class="negin2">1798.&mdash;What renders the Cow Pox Virus so extremely singular is, that
the person who has been thus affected is for ever after secure from
the infection of the Small Pox; neither the exposure to the
variolous effluvia, nor the insertion of the matter into the skin,
producing this distemper.</p>

<p class="negin2">It is curious to observe, that the virus, which with respect to its effects
is undetermined and uncertain previously to its passing from the
horse through the medium of the cow, should then not only become
more active, but should invariably and completely possess those
specific properties which induce in the human constitution symptoms
similar to those of the variolous fever, and effect in it that peculiar
change which for ever renders it unsusceptible of the variolous
contagion.</p>

<p class="negin2">It clearly appears that this disease leaves the constitution in a state of
perfect security from the infection of the Small Pox.&mdash;Pp. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>, <a href="#Page_337">337</a>.</p>

<p class="negin2">1800.&mdash;The scepticism that appeared even among the most enlightened
of medical men, when my sentiments on the important subject of
the Cow Pox were first promulgated, was highly laudable. To
have admitted the truth of a doctrine, at once so novel and so
unlike anything that had ever appeared in the Annals of Medicine,
without the test of the most rigid scrutiny, would have bordered
upon temerity; but now, when that scrutiny has taken place, not
only among ourselves, but in the first professional circles in Europe,
and when it has been uniformly found in such abundant instances,
that the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of the
genuine Cow Pox in the way that has been described, is never
afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by the Small
Pox, may I not with perfect confidence congratulate my country
and society at large on their beholding in the mild form of the Cow
Pox, an antidote that is capable of extirpating from the earth a
disease which is every hour devouring its victims; a disease that
has ever been considered as the severest scourge of the human
race.&mdash;Pp. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>, <a href="#Page_338">338-339</a>, <a href="#Page_357">357</a>, <a href="#Page_365">365</a>, <a href="#Page_473">473</a>.</p>

it secures the constitution as much as Variolous Inoculation possibly
can.&mdash;Baron’s <cite>Life of Jenner</cite>, vol. ii. p. 15.</p>

<p class="negin2">Duly and efficiently performed, Vaccination will protect the constitution
from subsequent attacks of Small Pox as much as that disease
itself will. I never expected that it would do more, and it will not,
I believe, do less.&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em> p. 135.</p>

<p class="negin2">1806.&mdash;The security given to the constitution by Vaccine Inoculation is
<em>exactly equal</em> to that given by the Variolous. To expect more
from it would be wrong. As failures in the latter are constantly
presenting themselves, we must expect to find them in the former

<p class="pfs80">ADDRESS OF THE SOCIETY.</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p class="noindent">Smallpox is a member of the group of diseases, described as zymotic
which originate in unwholesome conditions of life, and in common are
diminished and prevented by the reduction and removal of those conditions.</p>

<p>In times when the laws of health were imperfectly understood, it
was believed that by poisoning the blood with the virus of smallpox, or
cowpox, a future attack of smallpox might be escaped. While many
kindred medical practices have been discredited and forgotten, Vaccination,
endowed by the State, has survived, and has entered into legislation,
and is enforced with fine and imprisonment. It is in vain for
Nonconformists to plead that they do not believe that Vaccination has
any power to prevent or to mitigate smallpox, or that it is attended by
the risk of communicating foul diseases. They are told they may
believe what they like, but that vaccinated they must be, for the benefit
of the rite is settled beyond dispute, and that only fools and fanatics
venture to question what has been irrevocably determined.</p>

<p>It is to attack and overthrow this monstrous tyranny that the <span class="smcap">London
Society</span> has been established. The members desire to enlighten the
public mind as to the history of Vaccination, as to its injury in communicating
and intensifying other diseases, and as to the failure of the
compulsory law to stamp out or even diminish the ravages of smallpox.
Many too, whilst disinclined to discuss Vaccination as a medical question,
or to surrender confidence in its prophylaxy, are opposed to its
compulsory infliction. They maintain that every remedy should be left
to justify itself by its own efficacy, and that of all prescriptions the last
which requires extraneous assistance is Vaccination; for its repute is
based on the fact that its subjects are secure from smallpox, and in that
security may abide indifferent to those who choose to neglect its salvation.
Even nurses in smallpox hospitals, it is said, when efficiently
vaccinated and revaccinated, live unaffected in the variolous atmosphere.
Therefore, they hold that to compare an unvaccinated person to a
nuisance, as is frequently done, is to make use of an epithet that
implicitly denies the virtue asserted for Vaccination, a nuisance being
a voluntary danger or annoyance which another cannot conveniently
avoid. They also hold that to establish any medical prescription, and
to create interests identified with that prescription, is to erect a bar to
improvement; for it is obvious that any novelty in the treatment of
smallpox must, in the constitution of human nature, meet with resistance
from those whose emoluments are vested in the established practice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">London Society</span>, therefore, claims to enlist the energies, not only
of those who resist Vaccination as useless and mischievous, but also of
those who, true to their faith in liberty, would leave its acceptance to
the discretion of the individual. In the controversy into which they
enter, they propose to employ all the familiar agencies wherewith in
England revolutions are effected in the public mind and in Parliament;
and they appeal with confidence for the sympathy and support of their
countrymen. The Vaccination Acts under which they suffer have not
been enacted with the full cognizance of the nation, but have been forced
through indifferent Parliaments by the persistency of medical faction.
The members of the <span class="smcap">Society</span> are confident that, as soon as the truth
about Vaccination is fully known and appreciated, the freedom they
contend for will be conceded without fear, and that posterity will view
with amazement the outrage upon human right and reason that is at
present committed under the shadow of English liberty.</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p class="noindent">I would earnestly invite the attention of those who are concerned for
the repression of wrong, and the promotion of human welfare, to the
great and growing question of Vaccination. We hear on every side
that we cannot be secure from Smallpox unless we have our blood
poisoned with Cowpox in infancy, in adolescence, and at stated periods
throughout life. The prescription is so unnatural that only custom
renders it tolerable; it excites suspicion and aversion wherever rationally
considered; and dislike and disgust are justified by inquiry.
Smallpox is not averted by Vaccination; and the virus introduced to
the blood bears with it other diseases, even the worst of diseases, and
enfeebles and predisposes the constitution to other maladies. In short,
Vaccination under cover of maintaining the common health inflicts
upon it serious and deadly injuries. And by a strange exercise of
tyranny, this most mischievous superstition is made compulsory and
enforced by fine and imprisonment; and Englishmen are dragged from
their homes and treated as convicts because they refuse to submit their
children to the abominable rite. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> says, “<span class="smcap">The Law is
monstrous, and ought to be repealed.</span>” Yet is this monstrous law
maintained!</p>

<p>Possibly you are opposed to Vaccination, or indifferent, or a believer.
In any case, I ask you to subscribe for the <span class="smcap">Vaccination Inquirer</span>. If
you are opposed to Vaccination, it will stimulate and inform your
opposition; if indifferent, it will remove your indifference; if you are
a believer in the rite, it may convert you to a better mind.</p>

<p>Sir Lyon Playfair taken to Pieces and disposed of: likewise Sir
Charles W. Dilke, Bart.: being a Dissection of their Speeches in the
House of Commons on 19th June, 1883, in defence of Compulsory Vaccination.
Second Edition. 6th thousand. 1s.</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>“It is a very dainty pamphlet of two hundred pages, so printed that it is a luxury
to read. There are six pages of index, which will give some idea of its fulness of matter.
Mr. White does all his work in a workmanlike way, and this work is no exception.
He gives the two speeches of Playfair and Dilke in full, and fully answers them. They
are literally taken to pieces and disposed of. Read William White on Playfair and
Dilke. It is the end of controversy. Reply is impossible.”&mdash;<cite>Herald of Health.</cite></p>

<p>“Mr. White has done what has never been done before,&mdash;that is, he has taken to
pieces Sir Lyon Playfair’s speech, analysed his arguments, and exposed much of what
is untrustworthy. The book ought to be in the hands of all who desire to understand
the question of Vaccination.”&mdash;<cite>Newcastle Weekly Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>“This is a clever and most reasonable criticism and overhauling of Playfair and
Dilke’s opinions, of which the best idea can be gained from a study of the book itself,
which will be found complete in every detail.”&mdash;<cite>Brighton Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>“The official vindication of vaccination was contained in Sir Lyon Playfair’s speech
backed up by Sir Charles Dilke, and Mr. White has taken the various points of both
speeches, item by item, and has replied to them with a clearness and effectiveness
which must go far to shake the foundation of vaccination itself; whilst, in our view,
it effectually disposes of the plea for <em>compulsory</em> vaccination.”&mdash;<cite>Northamptonshire
Guardian.</cite></p>

<p>“Anti-Vaccinationists will gloat over these pages. It is said that anything can be
done with figures. We certainly at the time thought that Sir Lyon Playfair showed
they were in favour of vaccination. On reading Mr. White’s book we are just as keenly
impressed with an opposite view. We recommend the work to our readers.”&mdash;<cite>Eastern
Daily Press.</cite></p>

<p>“A remarkably well-written book by a practised hand. The subject is an unlovely
one, and the proverbial ‘both sides’ have much to say; but this book ought to
interest, amuse, and inform both sides. It everywhere tells of patient thought,
industrious research, and a keen mind.”&mdash;<cite>The Truthseeker.</cite></p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
